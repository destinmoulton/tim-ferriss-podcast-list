        <p>I’ve interviewed legendary storyteller Cal Fussman (<a href="https://twitter.com/calfussman" target="_blank">@calfussman</a>) on this show before (<a href="https://tim.blog/2016/03/11/the-interview-master-cal-fussman-and-the-power-of-listening/" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tim.blog/2016/08/31/cal-fussman-the-master-storyteller-returns/" target="_blank">here</a>), but this time, the roles are reversed, and he interviews me!</p><p>If you are not yet familiar with him, Cal&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author and a writer-at-large for&nbsp;<em>Esquire</em>&nbsp;magazine, where he is best known for being a primary writer of the “<a href="http://www.esquire.com/what-ive-learned-legends/" target="_blank">What I Learned</a>” feature. And&nbsp;this interview originally aired on Cal’s podcast, “<a href="https://www.calfussmanpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Big Questions with Cal Fussman</a>.”</p><p>Cal has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with the icons who’ve shaped the last 50 years of world history: Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Welch, Robert DeNiro, Clint Eastwood, Bruce Springsteen, Dr. Dre, Quincy Jones, Woody Allen, Barbara Walters, Pelé, Yao Ming, Serena Williams, John Wooden, Muhammad Ali, and countless others.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><strong>This podcast is brought to you by&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://foursigmatic.com/ferriss" target="_blank"><strong>Four Sigmatic</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;While I often praise this company’s lion’s mane mushroom coffee for a minimal caffeine wakeup call that lasts, I asked the founders if they could help me—someone who’s struggled with insomnia for decades—sleep. Their answer:&nbsp;<a href="http://foursigmatic.com/ferriss" target="_blank"><strong>Reishi Mushroom Elixir</strong></a>. They made a special batch for me and my listeners that comes without sweetener; you can try it at bedtime with a little honey or nut milk, or you can just add hot water to your single-serving packet and embrace its bitterness like I do.</p><p>Try it right now by going to&nbsp;<a href="http://foursigmatic.com/ferriss" target="_blank"><strong>foursigmatic.com/ferriss</strong></a>&nbsp;and using the code&nbsp;<strong>Ferriss</strong>&nbsp;to get 20 percent off this rare, limited run of Reishi Mushroom Elixir. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you’ll be disappointed.</p><p><strong>This episode is also brought to you by “</strong><a href="http://tim.blog/friday" target="_blank"><strong>5-Bullet Friday</strong></a><strong>,”&nbsp;</strong>my very own email newsletter, which every Friday features five bullet points of cool things I’ve found that week, including apps, books, documentaries, gadgets, albums, articles, TV shows, new hacks or tricks, and — of course — all sorts of weird stuff I’ve dug up from around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s free, it’s always going to be free, and you can subscribe now at&nbsp;<a href="http://tim.blog/friday" target="_blank"><strong>tim.blog/friday</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>In this podcast, I had the rare opportunity to interview three men in Level 4 maximum security at Kern Valley State Prison. There was no time to do homework on any of them, so I crossed my fingers and jumped in. It was incredibly nerve-wracking and, ultimately, incredibly rewarding and fun. Any expectations I might have had going in were exceeded. </p><p>I owe special thanks to <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/01/21/catherine-hoke/" target="_blank">Cat Hoke</a>, all the men who participate in Defy (the program Cat started), and all the staff and officers at Kern, including Chief Deputy Warden Goss who made it possible for me to bring recording equipment. Thank you for the help, sir!</p><p>If you're interested in a similar prison visit after listening to this episode, Cat now has five more trips lined up. Simply email admin@cathoke.com for more details. If this episode moves you in any way, make sure to check out <a href="https://defyventures.org/" target="_blank">Defy</a> and other groups doing this work and making an impact, like the <a href="http://www.antirecidivism.org/" target="_blank">Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC)</a>. </p><p>Enjoy! </p><p><strong>This podcast is brought to you by </strong><a href="https://helixsleep.com/tim" target="_blank"><strong>Helix Sleep</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I recently moved into a new home and needed new beds, and I purchased mattresses from Helix Sleep.</p><p>It offers mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleeping style without costing thousands of dollars. Visit <a href="https://helixsleep.com/tim" target="_blank"><strong>Helixsleep.com/TIM</strong></a> and take the simple 2-3 minute sleep quiz to get started, and the team there will build a mattress you'll love.</p><p>Its customer service makes all the difference.

Brown, former anchor of the Peabody award-winning public radio business program Marketplace, <strong>Business Wars</strong> shares the untold and very real stories of what goes on behind the scenes with the leaders, investors, and executives that take businesses either to new heights or utter ruin.</p><p>I recommend starting with the first one, <a href="http://wondery.fm/tim" target="_blank">Sudden Death</a>, which is the first of an eight-part series that chronicles the brutal business battle between Netflix and Blockbuster, and later HBO. Other episodes dig into epic face-offs that have shaped the landscape of what we buy and how we live, such as Marvel vs. DC, Nike vs. Adidas, Nintendo vs. Sony, and Hearst vs. Pulitzer.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-4">
        <p>Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show, where I share the habits, tools and patterns of world-class performers. This special short episode features insights from <strong>Adam Robinson</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/iamadamrobinson?lang=en" target="_blank">@IAmAdamRobinson</a>). His answers to my questions were highlighted in my most recent book, <a href="https://tribeofmentors.com/" target="_blank"><em>Tribe of Mentors</em></a>.</p><p>For those of you not familiar with Adam, he has made a lifelong study of outflanking and outsmarting the competition. He is a rated chess master who was awarded a Life Title by the United States Chess Federation. As a teenager, he was personally mentored by Bobby Fischer in the 18 months leading up to his winning the world championship.</p><p>Then, in his first career, he developed a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests as one of the two original co-founders of The Princeton Review. His paradigm-breaking — or “category killing,” as they say in publishing — test-prep book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-System-SAT-Princeton-Review/dp/0394743423?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank"><em>The SAT: Cracking the System</em></a>, is the only test-prep book ever to have become a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. After selling his interest in The Princeton Review, Adam turned his attention in the early ’90s to the then-emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing a program that could analyze text and provide human-like commentary. He was later invited to join a well-known quant fund to develop statistical trading models, and since, he has established himself as an independent global macro advisor to the chief investment officers of a select group of the world’s most successful hedge funds and family offices.</p><p>Adam has also been one of this show's most popular guests, and you can check out his first appearance <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/12/20/becoming-the-best-version-of-you/" target="_blank">here</a>, and his second <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/02/02/lessons-from-warren-buffett-bobby-fischer-and-other-outliers/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><strong>This podcast is brought to you by </strong><a href="http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank"><strong>99designs</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <strong>the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers</strong>.

He attended the University of Georgia and worked as a bond trader in Chicago before moving to New York to pursue photography. Followed by over 25 million people on social media, Humans of New York features daily glimpses into the lives of strangers on the streets of New York City.

        <p><strong>Liz Lambert</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/thelizlambert/" target="_blank">@thelizlambert</a>) first purchased a seedy motel on South Congress Avenue 23 years ago, and she transformed it into <a href="https://www.sanjosehotel.com" target="_blank">Hotel San José</a>, which has become known today as the quintessential "Austin" hotel. The success of Hotel San José, which sparked a revitalization in the city's now thriving South Congress district, led her to launch <a href="https://www.bunkhousegroup.com/" target="_blank">Bunkhouse Group</a>, a hospitality company founded on the pillars of design, music, and community-driven experiences.</p><p>In the course of chronicling her experiences with the residents of Hotel San José on video camera, she ended up making the <a href="https://sanjosehotelstore.com/products/last-days-dvd" target="_blank"><em>Last Days of the San José</em></a><em>, </em>a documentary that casts a fascinating light on human relationships in gentrification and urban renewal.

If you want to make better decisions, if you want to smile when other people cower, it offers real tools.</p><p>To quote Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel, "Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them." What if you could be a person who is improved by crisis? At the very least, it would give you opportunities no one else can see, let alone grasp. Much more important, it would make you a happier human being.</p><p>Here are a few sample chapters from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591846358/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank"><em>The Obstacle Is The Way</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>Please enjoy!</p><p><strong>This episode is brought to you by </strong><a href="https://teeter.com/Tim/" target="_blank"><strong>Teeter</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Inversion therapy, which uses gravity and your own body weight to decompress the spine or relieve pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves, seems to help with a whole slew of conditions. And just as a general maintenance program, it's one of my favorite things to do.</p><p>Since 1981, more than three million people have put their trust in <a href="https://teeter.com/Tim/" target="_blank"><strong>Teeter</strong></a> inversion tables for relief, and it's the only inversion table brand that's been both safety-certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device.

A longtime contributor to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/michael-pollan" target="_blank">New York Times Magazine</a>, he also teaches writing at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley where he is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism. In 2010, Time magazine named him one of the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984745_1984934,00.html" target="_blank">100 most influential people in the world</a>.</p><p>His most recent book, <a href="http://bit.ly/2If9eXz" target="_blank">How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence</a>, might be my favorite yet. This is the first podcast interview Michael has done about the book, the science and applications of psychedelics, his exploration, and his own experiences. It is a wild ride.</p><p>In fact, partially due to this book, I am committing a million dollars over the next few years to support the scientific study of psychedelic compounds. This is by far the largest commitment to research and nonprofits I've ever made, and if you'd like to join me in supporting this research, please check out <a href="http://tim.blog/science." target="_blank">tim.blog/science</a>.</p><p>In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover many things, including:</p><ul><li>The fundamentals of "psychedelics," what the term means, and what compounds like psilocybin, mescaline, and others have in common.</li><li>New insights related to treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, alcohol/nicotine dependence, OCD, PTSD, and more.</li><li>Recent scientific and clinical discussions of a "grand unified theory of mental illness."</li><li>Potential applications and risks of psychedelics.</li><li>Michael's own experiences — which he did not initially intend on having — and what he's learned from them.</li><li>The "entropic brain," and why there might be a therapeutic sweet spot between mental order and chaos.</li><li>Why researchers at Johns Hopkins, NYU, Yale, and elsewhere are dedicating resources to understanding these compounds.</li><li>And much, much more...</li></ul><p><br></p><p>The molecules discussed in this episode — and some incredible clinical results from well-designed studies — have absolutely captured my attention over the last two years. After wading in and supporting smaller studies, I've decided to go all-in on scientists exploring this area. It seems to be an Archimedes lever for potentially solving a wide range of root-cause problems, instead of playing whack-a-mole with symptoms one by one.</p><p><strong>This episode is brought to you by </strong><a href="https://teeter.com/Tim/" target="_blank"><strong>Teeter</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Inversion therapy, which uses gravity and your own body weight to decompress the spine or relieve pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves, seems to help with a whole slew of conditions. And just as a general maintenance program, it's one of my favorite things to do.</p><p>Since 1981, more than three million people have put their trust in <a href="https://teeter.com/Tim/" target="_blank"><strong>Teeter</strong></a> inversion tables for relief, and it's the only inversion table brand that's been both safety-certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device. For a limited time, my listeners can get the Teeter inversion table with bonus accessories and a free pair of gravity boots — a savings of over $148 — <strong>by going to </strong><a href="https://teeter.com/Tim/" target="_blank"><strong>Teeter.com/Tim</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><p><strong>This podcast is also brought to you by </strong><a href="https://helixsleep.com/tim" target="_blank"><strong>Helix Sleep</strong></a>. I recently moved into a new home and needed new beds, and I purchased mattresses from Helix Sleep. It offers mattresses personalized to your preferences and sleeping style — without costing thousands of dollars. Visit <a href="https://helixsleep.com/tim" target="_blank"><strong>Helixsleep.com/TIM</strong></a> and take the simple 2-3 minute sleep quiz to get started, and the team there will build a mattress you'll love. <strong>Plus you’ll get up to $125 off your mattress order.</strong></p>

        <p>This is a special episode of the podcast. In writing Tribe of Mentors, I reached out to many people to be featured in the book. More than 130 people said yes -- but many others said no. This episode covers rejection, and -- more specifically -- how to reject other people and opportunities (even if they seem great). How you can you say no to seemingly burdensome "obligations," and say yes to the critical few opportunities. Understanding the difference -- and how to do it -- can make a significant impact on your life and your happiness. Enjoy!</p><p>This podcast is brought to you by&nbsp;ConvertKit.

        <p>This episode will forever have special meaning for me. While I didn't know it at the time, this ended up being the final long-form interview with Terry Laughlin (<a href="https://twitter.com/TISWIM" target="_blank">@TISWIM</a>). Terry passed away from cancer complications on October 20, just two weeks after we recorded this interview.</p><p>Terry was the founder of <a href="http://www.totalimmersion.net/" target="_blank">Total Immersion Swimming</a> and co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743253434/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way To Swim Better, Faster, and Easier</a>. He had a profound impact on me -- teaching me to overcome a lifelong fear of water and swimming (<a href="https://tim.blog/2008/08/13/total-immersion-how-i-learned-to-swim-effortlessly-in-10-days-and-you-can-too/" target="_blank">read all about it here</a>). But more than that, he's been an inspiration for the way I've done anything since.</p><p>Terry coached three college and two USA Swimming club teams from 1973 to 1988, improving each team dramatically. In that time, he developed 24 national champions at all strokes and distances -- the first national champions produced by four different teams.</p><p>In 1989, Terry founded Total Immersion and turned his focus from working with young, accomplished swimmers to adults with little experience or skill (like me). But it's not just about swimming; Terry's elegant method of deconstruction and logical progression is the epitome of what I strive to do when I'm talking about learning any skill -- from investing to learning languages.</p><p>It's with a heavy heart but much gratitude that I was able to interview Terry before he passed.&nbsp;Please enjoy, savor, and digest what Terry had to impart. And&nbsp;be sure to check out Terry's gift for listeners to this podcast:<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.totalimmersionacademy.com/pages/tim" target="_blank"><strong>a free seven-day membership to the Total Immersion Academy online training center</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Eric Ripert (@ericripert) is recognized as one of the best chefs in the world. In 1995, at just 29 years old, he earned a four-star rating from The New York Times. Twenty years later and for the fifth consecutive time, Le Bernardin, where Eric is the chef and a co-owner, again earned the highest rating of four stars, becoming the only restaurant to maintain this superior status for such a marathon length of time. In 1998, the James Beard Foundation named him Top Chef in New York City and, in 2003, Outstanding Chef of the Year. In 2009, Avec Eric, his first TV show, debuted and ran for two seasons, earning two Daytime Emmy Awards. It returned for a third season on the Cooking Channel in 2015. Eric has also hosted the show On the Table on YouTube, which debuted in July 2012, and he has appeared in media worldwide. He is the author of the New York Times best-selling memoir 32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line, Avec Eric, and several other books. In this episode we discuss: daily routines, conquering weakness and anger, mindfulness and meditation, the art of hiring, and much, much more.

I've found that if you prioritize sleep and recovery, it magnifies everything else in your life -- and to a greater extent than diet or exercise.

        Ray Dalio (@raydalio) grew up a middle-class kid from Long Island. He started his investment company Bridgewater Associates out of a two-bedroom apartment at age 26, and it now has roughly $160 billion in assets under management. Over 42 years, he has built Bridgewater into what Fortune considers the fifth most important private company in the U.S. Along the way, Dalio became one the 100 most influential people in the world (according to Time) and one of the 100 wealthiest people in the world (according to Forbes). Because of his unique investment principles that have changed industries, aiCIO Magazine called him "the Steve Jobs of investing." Ray believes his success is the result of principles he's learned, codified, and applied to his life and business. Those principles are detailed in his new book Principles: Life and Work. In this interview, we cover a lot, including:  How Ray thinks about investment decisions, how he thinks about correlation, etc. The three books he would give to every graduating high school or college senior How he might assess cryptocurrency And much, much more...

He has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with a long list of icons who've shaped the last 50 years of world history. I've been trying to get Cal to do his own podcast. Rather than overthinking it, I simply asked Cal to interview a friend who I would also love to have on the podcast: Larry King. This episode is the result of that request. Larry King (@kingsthings) has been dubbed "The most remarkable talk show host on TV, ever" by TV Guide and "Master of the mic" by Time Magazine. Larry's been described as the Muhammad Ali of the broadcast interview, and he's been inducted into five of the nation's leading broadcasting halls of fame.

I've gathered some of the best advice about coping with frustrations and roadblocks, and -- ultimately -- learning how to turn failure into success. These conversations are extremely valuable because they show you there is more than one way to achieve your goals. After more than 200 conversations with the world's top performers, you start to spot certain patterns. These are the shared habits, hacks, philosophies, and tools that are the common threads of success, happiness, health, and wealth. Behind each success story is usually a lesson on how to overcome failure.

        I'm very excited to share this episode. It's our first "roundtable" approach to discussing a single topic. This came about when I asked 5-Bullet Friday subscribers (sign up here if you're interested) to send me questions, and one that stuck out was: Where's the line between stubbornly pursuing an idea that isn't working and the patience and persistence needed to actually make it work? In other words -- when should you give up and quit and when should you push on? Since this is something I myself have struggled with, I came to the conclusion that I should reach out to people who might have a better answer. So, I sent the question to the following entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators:  Scott Belsky Seth Godin James Altucher Debbie Millman Adam Robinson Chase Jarvis Rhonda Patrick  Their answers are a thorough overview of how to assess your own ideas and opportunities, and determine which ones worth pursuing.

        Mark Bell (@MarkSmellyBell) is the founder of Super Training Gym in Sacramento, which is often referred to as "the strongest gym in the West." Prior to opening his own gym, he spent time studying training under the legendary Louie Simmons at Westside Barbell. Mark is no stranger to the iron at all. His best "geared lifts" in competition include a 1,025 lb. squat (465 kg), an 832 lb. bench press (77 kg), a 738 lb. deadlift (335 kg). Mark is also the inventor of the patented Slingshot, a device used to assist a lifter in maintaining proper bench press form while also allowing him or her to use more weight or perform more reps. Mark now has an entire line of products and has been spectacularly successful. In this episode, we cover a lot, including:  Mark's most important lessons for building strength. How to avoid injury and breakdown. Lesser-known training techniques that nearly everyone overlooks. How Mark became a millionaire by offering his gym memberships for free. And much, much more.  We recorded this interview while touring his facility in Sacramento, looking at some crazy equipment that you can see by visiting tim.blog/supertraining. Please enjoy!

        Kyle Maynard (@kylemaynard) is a motivational speaker, bestselling author, entrepreneur, and ESPY award-winning mixed martial arts athlete, known for becoming the first quadruple amputee to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Aconcagua without the aid of prosthetics. Oprah Winfrey called Kyle "one of the most inspiring young men you will ever hear about." Arnold Schwarzenegger described him as "the real deal," "a champion human," and "one of the most inspiring people" he's ever met. Even the great Wayne Gretzky has spoken of Kyle's "greatness." Despite being born with a rare condition that left him with arms that end at the elbows and legs that end near his knees, he learned early on with the support of his family to live life independently and without prosthetics. Kyle thrives on physical challenges and, following a few rough middle school football seasons, he went on to become a champion wrestler, CrossFit Certified Instructor and gym owner, competitive MMA/Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter, world record-setting weightlifter, and skilled mountaineer.

        On this special episode, we're going to share with you the "10 Commandments for Startup Success." They're drawn from the new podcast Masters of Scale, which is hosted by my friend and today's guest Reid Hoffman (@reidhoffman). Reid has been on the show before, and you might remember him as the co-founder of LinkedIn, and the partner at Greylock who invested early in Facebook, Airbnb, Zynga, and a bunch of other startups that experience dramatic success. On this new podcast, Reid shares his theories on how companies scale from zero to a gazillion, and he tests them with famous founders like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Reed Hastings of Netflix. He and his team pulled together a special remix for us to use on today's show -- distilling the very best, most actionable advice from the first season of Masters of Scale into these 10 commandments. They've included a lot material that hasn't aired yet. So even if you're already a subscriber, you'll hear some new things here. Stick around after we count down the 10 commandments because Reid was kind enough to answer a few of my questions. Please enjoy!

This episode covers some of our favorite travel tools. Kevin is Senior Maverick at Wired Magazine, which he co-founded in 1993. He also co-founded the All Species Foundation, a non-profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth. In his spare time, he writes bestselling books, co-founded The Rosetta Project, which is building an archive of all documented human language, and serves on the board of The Long Now Foundation. As part of The Long Now Foundation, he's investigating how to revive and restore endangered or extinct species, including the Wooly Mammoth. His newest critically acclaimed book is The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future.

This episode is brought to you by Exo Protein. These guys are making protein bars using cricket protein powder. Before you look disgusted, I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before! With recipes that were developed by a three-Michelin-star chef, the bars are paleo-friendly, with no gluten, no grains, no soy, no dairy, and they won't spike your glycemic response. In fact, they're less processed than any other protein bars you'll be able to find. Exo Protein is offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss Show listeners if you go to ExoProtein.com/Tim, you can try a sampler pack with all of the most popular flavors for less than $10. This is a startup with limited inventory that sells out all the time, so act fast! This podcast is also brought to you by Four Sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now — this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to foursigmatic.com/tim and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you’ll be disappointed.

        Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) is a polymath. The breadth and depth of his interests and knowledge are truly astounding. He's a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer best known for his pioneering research in digital contracts and cryptocurrency. The phrase and concept of "smart contracts" were developed by Nick with the goal of bringing what he calls the "highly evolved" practices of contract law and practice for the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet. Nick also designed Bit Gold, which many consider the precursor to Bitcoin. This wide-ranging conversation is co-hosted by Naval Ravikant, a mutual friend and one of the most successful investors in Silicon Valley, who also happens to be one of Nick's biggest admirers. We cover a lot, including:  What is Bitcoin, what are cryptocurrencies, and what problem do they solve? What is "social scalability?" What is Ethereum and what makes it unique? Strengths and weaknesses? How will smart contracts actually get adopted or go mainstream? What are ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings)? Blockchain governance -- is there any existential risk? "Wet" versus "dry" code Pascal's scams Quantum thought What fields will you be working on in the future?  Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-83">
        Vince Vaughn (@WildWest) is one of the most prolific actors, writers, and producers in the world. He's acted in more than thirty major motion pictures that have gone on to gross more than 1.7 billion at the box office. He is largely credited for redefining the R-rated comedy with his performance in the 2005 hit Wedding Crashers, which set the record for highest grossing R-rated comedy at the time. He is -- and will continue to be, I expect -- one of the most sought-after leading men in Hollywood. As a listener to this podcast, Vince reached out with his production company Wild West to see if we might do a TV show together. The result is Fear{less} with Tim Ferriss -- "less" is in parentheses because the objective is to teach you to fear less, not to be fearless. More details about the show can be found at tim.blog/fearless. I got the chance to catch up with Vince at Vulture Festival in New York City. In this conversation, we get into stories of his early beginnings, how to negotiate, his cold-calling career, and important decisions he's made as a producer, an artist, and a businessperson. I had a blast doing this, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        Phil Keoghan (@PhilKeoghan) has worked in television for almost thirty years on more than a thousand program episodes in more than a hundred countries. His work has earned him numerous awards, including ten prime-time Emmys. He is perhaps best known as the co-executive producer and host of CBS series The Amazing Race, currently in its twenty-ninth season. But there is much, much more to Phil's story, including unbelievable bucket lists, near-death experiences, and more. As just one example... In 2013, he decided to retrace the 1928 Tour de France riding an original vintage bicycle, with no gears, to tell the forgotten underdog story of the first English-speaking team to take on the toughest sporting event on earth. This experience was captured and turned into the brand-new film Le Ride, a gorgeous documentary and the first to be shot on a Sony F55 camera in 4K, which is equivalent to Super 35mm film. There are many takeaways from this conversation, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        I've wanted to speak with psychotherapist Esther Perel for years. In a cover story, The New York Times called her the most important game changer in sexuality and relational health since Dr. Ruth. Her TED talks on maintaining desire and rethinking infidelity have more than 17 million views, and she's tested and been exposed to everything imaginable in thirty-four years of running her private therapy practice in New York City. In this episode, Esther and I explore:  How to find (and convince) mentors who can change your life. What she's learned from Holocaust survivors. Polyamory and close cousins. Is there such a thing as too much honesty in relationships? Can we want what we already have? Why do happy people cheat? And much more.  Esther is the author of the international bestseller  Mating in Captivity, which has been translated into 26 languages. Fluent in nine of them (I've heard her in person), this Belgian native now brings her multicultural pulse to her new book  The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity (October 2017, Harper Collins). Her creative energy is right now focused on co-creating and hosting an Audible original audio series, Where Should We Begin.

        This episode is by request. You have asked me many times for an episode on education, accelerated learning, and my mentors. It will all be covered in the following conversation with Charles Best (@charlesbest), the founder and CEO of DonorsChoose.org, a nonprofit website that enables anyone to help a classroom in need. It is one of my favorite companies -- profit or non-profit -- in the world. (And I'm not just saying that because we used to be wrestling partners in high school.) Charles founded DonorsChoose.org back in 2000 at a public high school in the Bronx where he taught history. Flash forward to 2017, and DonorsChoose.org is one of Oprah Winfrey's "ultimate favorite things" and made the cover of Fast Company as one of the "50 Most Innovative Companies in the World," the first time a charity has received such recognition. To date, teachers at more than seventy percent of all the public schools in America have created classroom project requests on DonorsChoose.org, and more than two million people have given to those projects. Charles joined me for a conversation at SXSWedu in front of an audience of educators and administrators to talk about learning things faster, good teaching versus bad teaching, the value of tough love, and much more.

        Dr. Arthur De Vany is nearly eighty years old and ripped. Better known as Art De Vany, he was signed as a professional baseball player in his youth and later earned his Ph.D. in Economics at UCLA. He is most famous for his "evolutionary fitness" approach to training and diet, and our conversation focuses on that. During his time at UCLA, Art did many things, including creating mathematical and statistical models to precisely describe the motion picture market. Art is Professor Emeritus of Economics of the University of California, Irvine, and is a member of its acclaimed Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences. A lifelong student of metabolism and fitness, Art has lived as a Paleo athlete for more than thirty years and is considered a "patriarch" of the Paleo movement. He believes there is no such thing as "healthy" aging and that we can intervene to protect against the aging process. In this episode, we talk about his daily schedule, workout routines, why he never gets sick, ice ages, economics, philosophies of intermittent everything, and really dig into the details of a fascinating man.

Prior to holding that position, Ryan was the Founder and President of Prolific Athletes LLC, a sports performance facility in San Diego, California, where he trained some of the world's best athletes. His clients include Serena Williams, Russell Wilson, the Arizona Cardinals, Marcus Mariota, Jameis Winston, and hundreds of other professional athletes. While he is well known for dramatically improving his athletes' speed, more and more athletes (and coaches) seek Ryan out for his training and guidance on injury prevention. Many of Ryan's clients have made remarkable recoveries from injuries, and several NFL teams and European soccer clubs have sought his methodology to implement into their training programming. Ryan developed an algorithm called "Force Number" that is based on the hex (or trap) bar deadlift and body weight to predict speed such as the forty-yard dash. In this discussion, we talk about exercises for reducing injury potential, how Ryan uses the Force Number, what his workouts look like from warmup to finish, how he helped Meb Keflezighi train for his Boston Marathon victory, how to go from sprinting to long distance running, and lots more.

        Murray Carter (@CarterCutlery) is a Canadian craftsman like no other. At eighteen, he fell into an apprenticeship with a sixteenth generation Yoshimoto bladesmith that lasted six years -- and was asked to take the position of number seventeen in the Sakemoto family tradition (perhaps the only Caucasian ever to have had the honor and privilege of this position). Murray continued forging blades in Japan for twelve more years and in June 2001, he was awarded the rating of Mastersmith by the American Bladesmith Society, thus proving the highest degree of competency by Western standards. In 2005, he moved to the United States (as an Alien of Extraordinary Ability, no less) to start Carter Cutlery; he has continued forging blades in Oregon since. This is a fascinating episode on many levels, so please enjoy! This podcast is brought to you by Headspace, the world’s most popular meditation app (with more than four million users). It’s used in more than 150 countries, and many of my closest friends swear by it. Try Headspace’s free Take10 program — 10 minutes of guided meditation a day for 10 days. It’s like a warm bath for your mind. Meditation doesn’t need to be complicated or expensive, and it’s had a huge impact on my life. Try Headspace for free for a few days and see what I mean. This podcast is also brought to you by Four Sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now -- this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to foursigmatic.com/tim and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you'll be disappointed.

        Dorian Yates (@dorian_yates) is a six-time Mr. Olympia who has taken the already extreme sport of bodybuilding to a new level. He's one of my adolescent heroes whose innovations in training (e.g., Occam's protocol) influenced what I later put into The 4-Hour Body. In this particular conversation, we dig into all sorts of topics that I've been dying to ask Dorian since I was a teenager. We discuss his relationship to pain, specific workouts, how he warms up, common mistakes and misconceptions, self-talk, his favorite books, and much more. I sincerely hope you enjoy this conversation with Dorian Yates as much as I did! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        Marie Kondo (@MarieKondo, also known as "KonMari") is a Japanese organizing consultant, author, and entrepreneur. She developed a revolutionary method of organizing known as the KonMari Method, which consists of gathering together everything you own, one category at a time, and then keeping only those things that "spark joy" -- as well as choosing a dedicated place to store them. Going far beyond a typical tidying how-to, her method is a way of life and a state of mind. Marie captured the findings in her mega-best-selling books, including The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing and its follow-up, Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up. Her books have sold more than seven million copies and have been published in more than forty countries. Kondo's methods have become so famous that her last name has become a verb, 'Kondo-ing,' and people who share her specific values are referred to as 'Konverts.' She has been named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people. Marie is also the Founder and Chief Visionary Officer of KonMari Media Inc. ("KMI"), a US-based startup with a mission to "Organize the World" by combining the power of technology and a network of Konverts and partner organizations. KMI also recently launched a KonMari Consultant Training Program and certification process. We dig into Shintoism, Marie's upbringing, specific details of her method, and much more.

         Cory Booker (@corybooker) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from New Jersey. I generally have an allergy to politics, but Cory's story is endlessly fascinating (e.g., he's faced down death threats from gangs, run into burning buildings, and much more), and we have a few years of history together. We cover a lot in this wide-ranging catch-up conversation, including his diet, lessons from early mentors and athletics, routines, books that have had an impact, learning how to "street fight" in New Jersey after receiving a Rhodes Scholarship, and much more. Cory began his political career as a city councilor from 1998 to 2002 in Newark, New Jersey's largest city. He later served as mayor of Newark, which under his leadership entered its biggest period of economic growth since the 1960s -- the first new downtown hotels were constructed in forty years, the first new office towers in twenty. He then won the Senate Democratic primary in August of 2013, and then won the general election on October 16, 2013, becoming the first African-American U.S. Senator from New Jersey. Cory is also the author of The New York Times bestseller United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good. I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did!

        Welcome to the second installment of The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour. After more than 200 conversations with the world's top performers, you start to spot certain patterns. These are the shared habits, hacks, philosophies, and tools that are the common threads of success, happiness, health, and wealth. These commonalities were the premise of my most recent book, The New York Times #1 bestseller Tools of Titans -- a compilation of my favorite lessons, routines, and tips of many of my guests. In this particular episode, I've gathered some of the best advice from past guests about fitness, nutrition, and wellness. This includes conversations with:  General Stanley McChrystal about thriving on one meal per day. Tony Robbins about morning discipline and routines. Wim Hof about consciously controlling his autonomic immune system. Dominic D'Agostino about nutritional strategies for peak performers.  Without further ado, let's get started. I hope you enjoy this episode of The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

I depended on iD to handle these types of details when I launched The 4-Hour Chef so I could focus on promoting the book.

        This is round two for Debbie Millman, whose first interview on this show quickly became one of the most downloaded episodes of all time (listen to it here). Graphic Design USA has named Debbie Millman (@debbiemillman) "one of the most influential designers working today." She is also the founder and host of Design Matters, the world's first and longest-running podcast about design, where she's interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries and cultural commentators including Massimo Vignelli and Milton Glaser. Debbie's done it all. Her artwork has been exhibited around the world. She's designed everything from wrapping paper to beach towels, greeting cards to playing cards, notebooks to t-shirts, and Star Wars merchandise to global Burger King rebrands. Debbie is the President Emeritus of AIGA (one of only five women to hold the position in the organization's one-hundred-year history), the editorial and creative director of Print magazine, and the author of six books. In 2009, Debbie co-founded (with Steven Heller) the world's first masters program in branding at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, which has received international acclaim. This time around, Debbie answers the most popular questions submitted by you, the listeners. Topics include:  How to turn down stability for opportunity. How Debbie made the leap and continues to try new things. How to outsmart the competition in any job. The future of graphic design. Debbie's own personal creative process. The most valuable lessons Debbie has learned about designing an ideal life for herself.  Here's Debbie Millman's round two. Enjoy!

Wealthfront monitors your portfolio every day across more than a dozen asset classes to find opportunities for rebalancing and harvesting tax losses, and now manages more than $5B in assets. Unlike old-fashioned private wealth managers, Wealthfront is powered by innovative technology, making it the most tax-efficient, low-cost, hassle-free way to invest. Go to wealthfront.com/tim to take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and it'll show you -- for free -- exactly the portfolio it would recommend. If you want to just take the advice and do it yourself, you can. Or, as I would, you can set it and forget it. Well worth a few minutes: wealthfront.com/tim.

        Ricardo Semler (@ricardosemler) is the former CEO of Semco Partners, a Brazilian company best known perhaps for its radical form of industrial democracy and corporate re-engineering. During his leadership, Semco grew from four million in 1982 to two hundred and twelve million in 2003. His innovative -- but very controversial -- business management policies have attracted widespread interest from all over the world. He is the best-selling author of Maverick: The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace and The Seven-Day Weekend: A Better Way to Work in the 21st Century (not to be confused with another book titled in an admittedly similar fashion). Ricardo recently started a podcast called LeadWise, where he has conversations with leaders about "challenging assumptions and changing how we live and work." Entrepreneurship and education are just two of the topics discussed in this wide-ranging conversation. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Ricardo Semler as much as I did!

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-98">
        Jerzy Gregorek (@TheHappyBody) immigrated from Poland to the United States with his wife, Aniela, in 1986 as political refugees. He subsequently won four World Weightlifting Championships and established one world record. In 2000, Jerzy and Aniela founded UCLA's weightlifting team. As co-creator of The Happy Body Program, Jerzy has been mentoring people for more than 30 years. In 1998, Jerzy earned an MFA in writing from the Vermont College of Fine Arts. His poems and translations have appeared in numerous publications, including The American Poetry Review. His poem Family Tree was the winner of Amelia magazine's Charles William Duke Long Poem Award in 1998. Naval Ravikant (@naval) also joins us on this podcast, as he introduced me to Jerzy. Naval is the CEO and a co-founder of AngelList. He is an active angel investor and has invested in more than 100 companies. His deals include Twitter, Uber, Yammer, Postmates, Wish, Thumbtack, and OpenDNS, which Cisco bought for $635 million in cash.

I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now -- this is the answer.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-100">
        Dr. Philip Zimbardo (@PhilZimbardo) is one of the most distinguished psychologists in the world and a professor emeritus at Stanford University. He is arguably best known for his 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, in which students were turned into mock prisoners and guards for a continuous 24-hour-a-day study. The experiment was planned for two weeks but terminated after just six days. In this podcast, we explore how we -- as humans -- can do less evil, how you can be a "deviant for day," mindful disobedience, and much more. It was a blast. Apart from the above, Dr. Zimbardo has served as President of the American Psychological Association and designed and narrated the award-winning 26-part PBS series, Discovering Psychology. He has published more than 50 books, including Shyness, The Lucifer Effect, The Time Cure, The Time Paradox, and most recently, Man, Interrupted. Dr. Zimbardo currently lectures worldwide and is actively working to promote his non-profit, The Heroic Imagination Project. His current research looks at the psychology of heroism. The question he poses is: "What pushes some people to become perpetrators of evil, while others act heroically on behalf of those in need?"

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-101">
        John F. Crowley is the Chairman and CEO of Amicus Therapeutics, a publicly traded biotechnology company, which he helped to found in 2005 and is now a 300+ person company in 22 countries. John's involvement with biotechnology stems from the 1998 diagnosis of two of his children with Pompe disease -- a severe and often fatal neuromuscular disorder. In his drive to find a cure for them, he left his job and became an entrepreneur as the Co-founder, President, and CEO of Novazyme Pharmaceuticals in 2000, a biotech start-up conducting research on a new experimental treatment for Pompe disease (which he credits as ultimately saving his children's lives). In 2001, Novazyme was acquired by Genzyme Corporation for nearly $200 million. John and his family have been profiled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and are the subjects of a book by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Geeta Anand, The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million -- and Bucked the Medical Establishment -- in a Quest to Save His Children. The major motion picture Extraordinary Measures, starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford, is inspired by the Crowley family journey. John is the author of a personal memoir: Chasing Miracles: The Crowley Family Journey of Strength, Hope, and Joy. John also served as a commissioned intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve from 2005-2016. He was assigned to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and is a veteran of the global war on terrorism, with service in Afghanistan. He graduated with a B.S. in Foreign Service from Georgetown University, and earned a J.D. from the University of Notre Dame Law School and an M.B.A. from Harvard. He previously served (2014-2016) as the National Chairman of the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America and is a founding board member of the Global Genes Project. John is a Henry Crown Fellow at The Aspen Institute. This is an incredibly powerful episode. Enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        Jerrod Carmichael (@NotoriousROD) is pushing the boundaries of comedy with his groundbreaking work in stand-up, television, and film. Now just 29 years old, what this driven North Carolina native has accomplished is mind-boggling, and 2017 is going to be his biggest year yet. Jerrod stars in the hit NBC series The Carmichael Show, which he also writes and executive produces. The third season of the show premieres in 2017. In March of 2017, Jerrod will star in his second stand-up comedy special on HBO, directed by Bo Burnham. He made his debut on HBO in 2014 with his critically acclaimed one-hour special, Love at the Store, directed by Spike Lee. Love at the Store is the funniest standup special I've seen in many years, and it's the reason I reached out to Jerrod. It left me in hysterics on a transatlantic flight and terrified everyone. I couldn't stop laughing out loud. It's that good. On the big screen this June, Jerrod joins the cast of Michael Bay's Transformers: The Last Knight, opposite Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, and Anthony Hopkins. He'll also appear in James Franco's The Masterpiece, set to be released in 2017. In the summer of 2016, Jerrod reprised his role as 'Garf' in the Universal comedy sequel Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising opposite Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. He also starred as 'Freddy' opposite Rose Byrne, Susan Sarandon, and J.K. Simmons in Lorene Scafaria's The Meddler, which was released in April of 2016. Jerrod recently announced his upcoming authorial debut with an as-yet-untitled memoir. The novel will be published by Random House. Please enjoy my wide-ranging conversation with Jerrod Carmichael!

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-105">
        Mr. Money Mustache (@mrmoneymustache -- Pete Adeney in real life) grew up in Canada in a family of mostly eccentric musicians. He worked in various tech companies before retiring at age 30. Pete, his wife, and their now eleven-year-old son live near Boulder, Colorado, and have not had real jobs since 2005. This begs the question of "How?" In essence, they accomplished this early retirement by optimizing all aspects of their lifestyle for maximal fun at minimal expense, and by using basic index-fund investing. Their average annual expenses total a mere $25-27,000, and they do not feel in want of anything. Since 2005, all three of them have explored a free-form life of interesting projects, side-businesses, and adventures. In 2011, Pete started writing the Mr. Money Mustache blog about his philosophy, which has grown to reach about 23 million different people (and 300 million page views) since its founding. It has become a worldwide cult phenomenon, with a self-organizing community and incredible news coverage. This episode explores his story, philosophies, and routines.

In fact, some of my good investor friends in Silicon Valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it's all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams. Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they'll show you -- for free -- exactly the portfolio they'd put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Or, as I would, you can set it and forget it.  Well worth a few minutes: wealthfront.com/tim.

        Adam Robinson (@IAmAdamRobinson) first appeared on this podcast in the "Becoming the Best Version of You" episode (#210) alongside Josh Waitzkin (chess, jiu-jitsu, investing) and Ramit Sethi (personal finance, entrepreneurship). By popular demand, this is a dedicated episode of Adam's stories and life lessons. Adam Robinson has made a lifelong study of outflanking and outsmarting the competition. He is a rated chess master who was awarded a Life Title by the United States Chess Federation. As a teenager, he was personally mentored by Bobby Fischer in the 18 months leading up to his winning the world championship. Then, in his first career, he developed a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests as one of the two original co-founders of The Princeton Review. His paradigm-breaking -- or "category killing," as they say in publishing -- test-prep book, The SAT: Cracking the System, is the only test-prep book ever to have become a New York Times bestseller. After selling his interest in The Princeton Review, Adam turned his attention in the early '90s to the then-emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing a program that could analyze text and provide human-like commentary. He was later invited to join a well-known quant fund to develop statistical trading models, and since, he has established himself as an independent global macro advisor to the chief investment officers of a select group of the world's most successful hedge funds and family offices. In his spare time, he's also become pen pals with Warren Buffett. This is a wide-ranging conversation (aka conversational parkour) with lots of takeaways. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed recording it! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) has been called "Silicon Valley's most feared and well-liked journalist" by New York Magazine. Here's just one example: you can graph the impact on Yahoo's stock price by various posts by Kara. That's just the tip of the iceberg. She attended Georgetown's School of Foreign Service prior to changing course to journalism. It turns out many of the skills that would make a good spy are those that make a good journalist: developing sources, asking good questions, scenario planning, and much more. She forged her reputation at the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, and now she spends the majority of her time as Executive Editor of Recode and the host of the Recode Decode podcast. Over the last 11 years and alongside Walt Mossberg, she has also co-produced D: All Things Digital, a major high-tech conference with interviewees such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and many other leading players in the tech and media industries. In this podcast episode, she and I cover a lot of subjects, enjoy quite a few laughs, and dig into details you can readily apply and test yourself. Topics include:  The art and craft of good questions Lessons learned and favorite moments from interviewing Steve Jobs What separates good from great journalists War stories, missed opportunities, and "optimistic pessimism"  I hope that you enjoy this episode with Kara Swisher!

        Arnold Schwarzenegger (@Schwarzenegger) told you he'd be back. In our first conversation (episode 60), the former Mr. Olympia, Terminator, and Governator shared lessons learned, daily routines, psychological warfare tactics, favorite books, early entrepreneurial ventures (and tips), meditation, and many stories no one had heard before. This time around, the new host of the Celebrity Apprentice answered your most popular and upvoted questions, including some controversial ones. He does not shy away from anything, and this is no exception. In this episode, among other things, Arnold talks about his recent Twitter battle with President-elect Donald Trump, his investment strategies, politics, the state of bodybuilding, his sleep schedule, and many more never-before-told stories. [Special thanks to Daniel Ketchell for pitching the questions here.] He forgot to plug his latest project, however, so I will: tune into the new Celebrity Apprentice Mondays at 8 p.m., or watch it on the NBC app. I hope you enjoy this incredible round 2 Q&A with Arnold Schwarzenegger!

        For some of you, this may be most important podcast episode you ever listen to.  I don't say that lightly. It has nothing to do with me and everything to do with my guest, who walks us through gripping stories, tactical details, humor, pain, and emotional redemption. We cover some sensitive and extremely important ground.  Thank you, Debbie. Graphic Design USA has named Debbie Millman (@debbiemillman) "one of the most influential designers working today." She is also the founder and host of Design Matters, the world's first and longest-running podcast about design, where she's interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries and cultural commentators including Massimo Vignelli and Milton Glaser. Debbie's done it all. Her artwork has been exhibited around the world. She's designed everything from wrapping paper to beach towels, greeting cards to playing cards, notebooks to t-shirts, and Star Wars merchandise to global Burger King rebrands. Debbie is the President Emeritus of AIGA (one of only five women to hold the position in the organization's one-hundred-year history), the editorial and creative director of Print magazine, and the author of six books.  In 2009, Debbie co-founded (with Steven Heller) the world's first masters program in branding at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, which has received international acclaim. We cover a lot in this discussion: how to recover from rejection, how to overcome personal crises of faith, class exercises from her most impactful mentors, and much more. Please enjoy (and reflect on) this wide-ranging conversation with Debbie Millman... Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        We're going to kick off the year with an in-betweenisode where I answer the most popular questions you've submitted. If you're wondering what you can do to ask a question that gets answered in the future, these are good criteria to follow:   I can answer it in a few minutes or less. It will help more than the one person asking. It will not immediately be irrelevant.  In contrast, here are some examples of questions that don't generally get answered:  "If you had $100 and six months, how would you turn it into $10,000 or $100,000, etc.?" "If there were one particular home business opportunity where I could make $2,000 additional per month, what would you suggest?"  If I had the magical answer to either of these, I'd use it for myself! And if there were an answer to share with one of you, I'd share it with my whole audience -- which diminishes its usefulness as a competitive edge considerably. Without further ado, here are the questions I'm answering this time around. Happy New Year! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-114">
        This episode is a review of the past year. Since it's been a common request, I thought I'd run through what I do at the end of a year. For the last 6 years, I no longer write resolutions. Instead, I do a post-game analysis where I really look back at the year behind, including what I've learned and what tips and recommendations had the biggest impact on my life. Thank you for all of your support, and I sincerely hope you enjoy my biggest lessons and takeaways from 2016! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by Four Sigmatic. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now -- this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to foursigmatic.com/tim and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you'll be disappointed. This podcast is also brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive (in a good way) set-it-and-forget-it investing service, led by technologists from places like Apple and world-famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last 2 years and now has more than $2.5B under management. In fact, some of my good investor friends in Silicon Valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it's all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams. Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Or, as I would, you can set it and forget it. Well worth a few minutes: wealthfront.com/tim.

        A.J. Jacobs (@ajjacobs) is a kindred guinea pig of self-experimentation who chronicles his shenanigans in books that seem to keep winding up as New York Times best sellers. The Know-It-All was about his quest to learn everything in the world. In The Year of Living Biblically, he tried to follow all the rules of the Bible as literally as possible. Drop Dead Healthy followed his well- (and ill-) advised experiments to become the healthiest person alive. My Life as an Experiment is about exactly what it sounds like, and It's All Relative -- which will be out in 2017 -- will aim to connect all of humanity in one family tree. A.J. is also the host of the new podcast Twice Removed, which takes a celebrity guest and introduces them to a surprise cousin they didn't know they had. It could be one of their heroes, an old friend, a teacher, etc. In this episode, we talk about:  What A.J.'s learned from his experiments His creative process His writing process Tipping points in his life How he learned to love marketing And much, much more.  I think you'll have a blast with this one -- I know I did. Please enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        This is a special episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. The audio is from a live conversation with not one, not two, but three guests: Josh Waitzkin, Ramit Sethi, and Adam Robinson. Josh Waitzkin is an endlessly fascinating person who gets mentioned a lot on this show for good reason. For the uninitiated, Josh was the basis for the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. He's perfected the techniques that made him into a chess prodigy and a jiu-jitsu black belt, and he shared them in his book The Art of Learning. Ramit Sethi (@ramit) is a personal finance guru who has built a huge company from his blog. He's the best-selling author of I Will Teach You to be Rich. Adam Robinson is the trusted outside global macro advisor to the heads of some of the world's largest hedge funds and family offices. He's written a best-seller on test preparation, developed artificial intelligence text analysis, been recognized as a chess master, and he's hilarious.

        My first live podcast in New York City was recorded at the 92nd Street Y to a sold-out crowd of about 900 people. This episode comes from The Random Show segment of the evening when I took the stage with Kevin Rose and Matt Mullenweg. Kevin Rose (@KevinRose) has been my partner in crime for many things. He's one of the best stock pickers in the startup world, the co-founder of Digg and Milk, a general partner at Google Ventures, and CEO of Hodinkee. Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) is most associated with a tool that powers more than 25% of the entire Web: WordPress. He's also the CEO of Automattic, which is a multi-billion dollar, fully distributed startup. We talk about lots of things -- including setting goals and New Year's resolutions. I hope you enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by Rhone Apparel. Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent YouTube videos?" They're a very specific set of shirts from Rhone. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me. Rhone has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout and a special holiday bonus. Find 'em at rhone.com/tim. This podcast is also brought to you by Wealthfront.

Considered a chess prodigy, Josh has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian jiu-jitsu (he's a black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia) and Tai Chi push hands (he's a world champion). These days, he spends his time coaching the world's top athletes and investors, working to revolutionize education, and tackling his new passion for paddle surfing (and nearly killing me in the process). I initially met Josh through his incredible book, The Art of Learning, which I loved so much that I helped produce the audiobook (download here on Audible). This episode is a highlight reel of sorts -- lessons I've learned from Josh and shared in my new book Tools of Titans. Please enjoy!

I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet. People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now, this is the answer.

It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and now has more than $2.5B under management. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it's all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams.

        Derek Sivers(@sivers) is one of my favorite humans, and I call him often for advice. Think of him as a philosopher-king programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. Originally a professional musician and circus clown (he did the latter to counterbalance being introverted), Derek created CD Baby in 1998. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100 million in sales for 150,000 musicians. In 2008, Derek sold CD Baby for $22 million, giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education. He is a frequent speaker at the TED Conference, with more than five million views of his talks. In addition to publishing 33 books via his company Wood Egg, he is the author of Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur, a collection of short life lessons that I've read at least a dozen times. I still have an early draft with highlights and notes. I posted the following on Facebook while writing this chapter: "I might need to do a second volume of [Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers], 100% dedicated to the knowledge bombs of Derek Sivers. So much good stuff. Hard to cut." Here's a bit of what made it into the first edition -- cherry-picked from the nuggets I've applied to my own life. Enjoy!

        I'm excited to bring you a little taste test of a new show format that I've been working on -- The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour. After 200 conversations with a variety of fascinating people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Foxx, Tony Robbins, Maria Popova, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, Amanda Palmer, Malcolm Gladwell, Rick Rubin, Reid Hoffman, Chase Jarvis, Sam Harris, Rainn Wilson, and so many others, I started to spot patterns. This is the premise of my new book Tools of Titans, which is a compilation of all of my favorite habits, philosophies, and tools of world-class performers. This is where Tim Ferriss Radio Hour comes in. In each episode, we'll take a deep dive into one specific topic or tactic, bringing together the collective genius of past guests -- with some new insights from yours truly -- to help you become world class in your own right (if you aren't already). In this episode, we'll be exploring meditation and mindfulness. You'll hear from Chase Jarvis as he explains his top priorities for feeling fulfilled. I talk transcendental meditation with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I cover a wide spectrum with Sam Harris, and ask him about everything from hallucinogens to meditation techniques. And then I wrap up with Rainn Wilson, discussing how to handle life when you feel overwhelmed. Without further ado, let's jump into the first episode of The Tim Ferriss Radio Hour!

        Susan Garrett (@susangarrett) is an incredible dog trainer. She has a B.Sc. in animal science, and for more than two decades has been one of the most consistently successful competitors in the sport of dog agility. Susan has been on the podium of the world and national championship events more than 50 times, winning those events a total of 38 times. She was of great help to me when I first adopted Molly, my own pup, and her book Shaping Success (The Education of an Unlikely Champion) was selected as the 2005 dog training and behavior book of the year. Susan is a champ not only for her competitive track record, but for her ability to convey concrete tips and recommendations for:  The most critical exercises for your dog The three types of reinforcement How to use crates properly What you should do in the first 24 hours of adopting a puppy How training a dog is like training an Olympic athlete And much, much more!  We discuss every facet of behavioral modification and conditioning, which applies to much more than dog training. These are techniques that work on everyone from chickens to cats to irritating in-laws. I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did!

Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent YouTube videos?" They're a very specific set of shirts from Rhone. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me. Rhone has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout. Find 'em at rhone.com/tim. This podcast is also brought to you by TrunkClub. I hate shopping with a passion. And honestly, I'm not good at it, which means I end up looking like I'm colorblind or homeless. Enter TrunkClub, which provides you with your own personal stylist and makes it easier than ever to shop for clothes that look great on your body. Visit trunkclub.com/tim, answer a few questions, and then you'll be sent a trunk full of awesome clothes.

        By request, we have another drunk dialing episode (the most recent one can be found here, and the original can be found here). This one is a little different as it's a Ladies Night edition. Some of you may have noticed that ladies were absent from the last drunk dialing fiasco. Why? It's just math. Looking at the results of a recent poll of 11,463 respondents, my audience is 84.04% male, 15.83% female, and .13% other. The people who sign up first get called first. The last time, three out of the 20, which is exactly 15%, were female. Unfortunately, those women (and several guys) did not pick up. This time around, I decided to try the "ladies night" format. In this episode, we discuss:  Language learning Exercising with (or around) injuries Viral marketing Handstands and handstand training How I decide my experiments (and what gets shared afterward) Teaching disabilities vs. learning disabilities The craft of writing: common mistakes, goals, etc.  Please enjoy!

Dave is a very technical coach and an elite-level Jiu-Jitsu competitor. He dominated the lightweight and open weight classes at the 1998 Rickson Gracie American Jiu-Jitsu Association tournament; the legendary Rickson Gracie himself bestowed the honor of Most Technical American Jiu-Jitsu Fighter upon him. He has worked not only with people on the ground game, but many recognizable MMA (mixed martial arts) figures as a coach and as a corner man. We'll delve into:  Tactical training Military training Hockey fights Defending yourself armed only with a flashlight How Dave's mom is the best sniping shot in the entire family And much, much more.

It is often called the "Grand Prix of endurance and efficiency." David is one of the most outspoken technologists out there. He is not one to hide his opinions or mince words.

It is mushroom coffee featuring chaga. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.

        Erik Vance (@erikvance) is an award-winning science writer based in California and Mexico City. After working as a scientist on research projects dealing with dolphin intelligence and coastal ecology, he became an educator and then an environmental consultant. In 2005, he attended UC Santa Cruz's famed Science Communication Program and discovered a passion for journalism. Since then, he has built his career around science-based profiles of inspiring or controversial figures. His work has appeared in Harper's Magazine, The New York Times, The Utne Reader, Scientific American, and National Geographic. He is also a contributing editor at Discover Magazine. His latest book is  Suggestible You: The Curious Science of Your Brain's Ability to Deceive, Transform, and Heal. This riveting narrative explores the world of placebos, hypnosis, false memories, and neurology to reveal the groundbreaking science of our suggestible minds. Could the secrets to personal health lie within our own brains?  Erik's firsthand dispatches will change the way you think -- and feel. In this episode, we cover many topics -- with equal amounts of the profound, actionable, and hilarious:  The power of placebo, and how you can increase the odds of it working for you (if you choose). Which conditions respond well to placebo, and which do not. How the mind, religion, bedside manner, and peer pressure can influence medical outcomes. Catching porcupines in South Africa. This story alone will make you laugh out loud and is worth the episode. Finding and studying a pig shit sommelier. Why he got electrocuted for half an hour at the NIH laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland. The story of why he chose to be cursed by a witch doctor in Mexico City.  Please enjoy!

        This episode was a blast. It was a tropical exploration of biology, life extension, and all good things. This included a lot of Carmenere wine and good old-fashioned ball busting. I was joined by: Peter Attia, MD (@peterattiamd), who rejoins the show (catch his last appearance here). He is a former ultra-endurance athlete (e.g., swimming 25-mile races), compulsive self-experimenter, and one of the most fascinating human beings I know. He is one of my go-to doctors for anything performance- or longevity-related. Peter earned his MD from Stanford University and holds a BSc in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He did his residency in general surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and conducted research at the National Cancer Institute under Dr. Steven Rosenberg, where Peter focused on the role of regulatory T cells in cancer regression and other immune-based therapies for cancer. David M. Sabatini, M.D., Ph.D. (@DMSabatini) of MIT's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. David is on a short list for the Nobel Prize for his work in elucidating the role of rapamycin and mTOR. Navdeep S. Chandel, Ph.D., the David W. Cugell Professor of Medicine and Cell Biology at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University. Nav established his lab there to further the understanding of how mitochondria work as signaling organelles to regulate physiology and pathology. He is also the author of Navigating Metabolism. Perhaps you've heard of people in Silicon Valley taking metformin, rapamycin, and supplements for longevity. In this conversation, we dig into the real science, what current evidence supports (or doesn't), and other important matters like how to staple properly, which fonts reasonable people use, and why Borat is a genius.

        Thanks to the gin I had tonight, this is a special episode. It is a drunk-dialing Q&A with you guys -- like we did around this time last year to celebrate the 100th episode. In preparation, I solicited phone numbers from listeners who wanted to receive a call from me. In this episode, I cover topics such as:  parenting advice from friends and guests how to get started in podcasting how to make a good sales pitch long-distance moves what I consider good advice and much, much more!  Without further ado, please enjoy this alcohol-fueled Q&A! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by Rhone Apparel. Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent YouTube videos?" They're a very specific set of shirts from Rhone. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me. Rhone has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout. Find 'em at rhone.com/tim. This podcast is also brought to you by Audible.

        This is a special episode because it doesn't focus on the lessons of one particular person. Instead, I explore the tips, tricks, and framework I've used to learn just about any skill. This is the meta-skill of meta-learning, or learning how to learn. I'm going to share techniques that can help you -- even if you're sub-par or a rote beginner -- take the smartest first steps and use 80/20 analysis to accelerate your progress. This is adapted from The 4-Hour Chef, which is the cookbook that's not a cookbook -- it's a book on accelerated learning. Without further ado, please enjoy this episode on meta-learning.

        This is another special in-betweenisode. It's a little shorter than the normal long-form episodes, and it features a Q&A with Shay Carl (@shaycarl). If you missed our first interview, Shay's story is incredible. He was a manual laborer for ages and uploaded his first YouTube video while on break from his job. Flash forward to today:  His SHAYTARDS channel now has roughly 2.3 BILLION views. Celebs like Steven Spielberg have appeared alongside Shay and his family. He co-founded Maker Studios, which sold to Disney for nearly $1 billion. He has been married 13 years and has five kids. He has lost more than 100 pounds since his overweight peak.  This time around, he answers listener questions in the way only he can, such as:  How to grow a YouTube following from scratch. The future of ad revenue and sponsorship. How he balances capturing the moment vs. experiencing the moment. His greatest obstacles in life. Lessons learned as a father. And much, much more.  I also wanted to announce my new book, Tools of Titans (Barnes and Noble, Books-A-Million, Amazon). It's the culmination of the last two years of this podcast. It's made up of my favorite takeaways, the lessons I've learned, and the tools I've applied to my own life from all of the guests on this show, including some new guests you've not yet met. Consider it the ultimate choose-your-own-adventure guide to optimizing your life -- it's got everything from finance to physical performance! Please enjoy this round two with Shay Carl.

Much of Dom's work is related to metabolic therapies and nutritional strategies for peak performance and resilience in extreme environments. Dom's research is supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Department of Defense (DoD), and other private organizations and foundations. In this episode, Dom focuses on disease prevention, cancer, and more mastery of the ketogenic diet. Please enjoy this tutorial and masterclass with Dominic D'Agostino.

        "Don't count on motivation; count on discipline." - Jocko Willink Jocko Willink (@jockowillink) is one of the scariest human beings imaginable. He is a lean 230 pounds. He is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is a legend in the Special Operations world. His eyes look through you more than at you. Jocko spent 20 years in the US Navy and commanded SEAL Team 3's task unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated special operations unit in the Iraq War. Upon returning to the US, Jocko served as the officer in charge of training for all West Coast SEAL teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic -- and perhaps psychotic -- combat training in the world (his words, not mine). After retiring from the Navy, he co-founded Echelon Front, a leadership and management consulting company and authored the number one New York Times bestseller Extreme Ownership: How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win. Jocko did his first interview ever with me (find it here), and it took the Internet by storm. Now he joins us for round two to answer the questions you've been asking.

        "You can't be grateful and angry simultaneously." - Tony Robbins The last time Tony Robbins (@tonyrobbins) was on the show, so many listeners found this one exercise helpful that they suggested I feature it on its own. This guided meditation is designed to help you overcome stress in a way that's backed with quantifiable neuroscience. If you've been worrying about unfinished business without resolution, this is a powerful tool to help you resolve the situation. This is very short and very powerful. Enjoy!

        My job is usually to deconstruct world-class performers and tease out their routines and habits you can use. But in this in-betweenisode, I'm going to present some short nuggets of practical, tactical philosophy about practicing what you preach. This is a letter from Stoic heavyweight Seneca the Younger -- who lived a mere 2,000 years or so ago -- to his friend Lucilius. It's from a collection of letters that comprise, effectively, my favorite book of all time. I've read it dozens of times, and I loved it so much that I turned it into The Tao of Seneca, a three-volume set of audiobooks. This is a letter you've not heard on the podcast before; it's worth the listen just for the definition of wisdom, alone. Then you have some incredible quotes from Epicurus, and it also discusses how you can have riches without riches having you. Enjoy!

        Shep Gordon (@SupermenschShep) has been named one of the "100 most influential people" by Rolling Stone magazine. He is the man behind some of the biggest names you've ever heard. If you like the storytelling and lessons of Cal Fussman, you're going to love this one. Shep has worked with, and befriended, some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, from Alice Cooper to Bette Davis, Raquel Welch to Groucho Marx, Blondie to Jimi Hendrix, Sylvester Stallone to Salvador Dali, Luther Vandross to Teddy Pendergrass. He is also credited with inventing the "celebrity chef" phenomenon, which revolutionized the food industry and turned the culinary arts into the multi-billion dollar industry it is today. He has worked with Nobu Matsuhisa, Emeril Lagasse, Wolfgang Puck, Roger Vergé (and many others, including his holiness, the Dalai Lama.) Anthony Bourdain, a huge fan of Shep's, released a memoir detailing Shep's life and adventures, titled They Call Me Supermensch: A Backstage Pass To The Amazing World Of Film, Food, and Rock 'N' Roll. I've been reading it, and it's fantastic. Imagine it like Animal House meets Harvard MBA. In this episode, we discuss how he made clients famous, and some of his biggest PR stunts (and flops). Enjoy!

        Cal (@calfussman) is a New York Times bestselling author and a writer-at-large for Esquire magazine, where he is best known for being a primary writer of the "What I Learned" feature. The Austin Chronicle has described Cal's interviewing skills as "peerless." He has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with the icons who've shaped the last 50 years of world history: Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Welch, Robert DeNiro, Clint Eastwood, Al Pacino, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen, Dr. Dre, Quincy Jones, Woody Allen, Barbara Walters, Pelé, Yao Ming, Serena Williams, John Wooden, Muhammad Ali, and countless others. When I asked listeners for questions to present to Cal during this return appearance, about 70 percent of you replied with some version of: "He is my favorite storyteller of all time. Please just let him talk for another four hours!" I hope you enjoy this as much as I did. I never get tired of talking to Cal. He's so good at what he does. He's such a nice guy. And he's such an incredible storyteller. Here you have it -- enjoy! This podcast is brought to you by Four Sigmatic.

        My guest on this episode of the podcast is Jason Nemer, co-founder of AcroYoga. Jason is an incredible character, who travels the world with next to nothing. He introduced me to my latest obsession -- AcroYoga. Along with Gymnastic Strength Training, I've been doing AcroYoga -- and I think about doing it all the time. AcroYoga is closer to partner acrobatics: Cirque du Soleil routine meets sensual-but-not-sexual contact. Even if you have no interest in doing AcroYoga yourself, there are many takeaways and recommendations in this episode that can benefit your life. And for those of you that are interested, we even do a couple of video demos, which can be found here. But don't feel like you need to step away from the purely audio experience of this podcast to follow along. Incidentally, the video was recorded at Creative Live, my favorite place to learn online.

        This episode is not going to deconstruct a world-class performer, per usual. This is a short, but very actionable and practical episode about the inner workings of my business. I was asked recently how I choose my projects. I riffed on this topic, and shared many thoughts on delegating tasks, future projects, and my involvement -- and break from -- the start-up community. I realized that the real question at the root of many of my decisions is: "How can I waste money to improve my quality of life?" This seems like a bad thing, but it is not. It is trading pennies for dollars. So how can you waste money to improve the quality of your life? I delve into this topic and  much more. I hope you'll get a lot out of it. Please enjoy!

        This is another jam-packed episode with Coach Chris Sommer, the former US national team gymnastics coach and founder of GymnasticBodies.  As a world-renowned Olympic coach, Sommer is known for building his students into some of the strongest, most powerful athletes in the world. While this is a stand-alone episode, you can (and should!) check out his last appearance, which is one of the most popular podcast episodes. We cover a lot in this episode, including:  What home equipment should someone invest in first (for $100 or less)? What are Coach Sommer's thoughts on weighted stretches? What does lower-body GST look like for a 40-year old former athlete? The best distinction between "mobility" and "flexibility." Exercise progressions for bar muscle-ups and most common mistakes in training for muscle-ups. Foam rolling or mobility tools: Do they have a place in GST? If so, favorite uses? How should taller people (say, over six feet tall) adjust GST? How should women adjust GST? And much, much more.  Enjoy!

        My job is usually to deconstruct world-class performers from business, military, entertainment, politics, or athletics, and then to tease out the routines and habits you can use. But in this in-betweenisode, Ryan Holiday, author of the book Ego Is the Enemy, shares a chapter called What's Important to You? This chapter alone is worth the price of the book, and it contains many fundamental truths that can be applied to business and life. (The book is also the newest addition to my book club, which can be found at audible.com/timsbooks.) If you like what Ryan has to say, check out the recent conversation we had, which dives deeper into what he's all about. Please enjoy!

        I'm very pleased to welcome Tony Robbins (@tonyrobbins) back to the show. (You can check out our previous in-depth conversations here: Part 1 and Part 2). For those of you that aren't familiar, Tony Robbins is the world's most famous performance coach. He's advised everyone from Bill Clinton to Mikhail Gorbachev to Serena Williams, and Leonardo DiCaprio to Oprah (who calls him "superhuman"). This time around, we discussed a number of topics we didn't get to cover in our previous interviews. I also hit him with some new rapid-fire questions. Some of the highlights of our conversation include:  Tony's best investment ever Quotes he lives by (and how he puts them into action) The worst advice he regularly hears Why he changed his diet for the first time since age 17 And much, much more  Without further ado, please enjoy this follow-up conversation with Tony Robbins.

        Seth Godin (@thisissethsblog) is the author of 17 bestselling books that have been translated into more than 35 languages. He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing, strategic quitting, leadership, and -- most of all -- challenging the status quo in all areas. His books include Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip, Purple Cow, and What to Do When it's Your Turn (and it's Always Your Turn). Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. His blog (which you can find by typing "Seth" into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. In 2013, Godin was inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame. Recently, Godin turned the book publishing world on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal in just three hours and became the most successful book project in Kickstarter history. His last episode was quite a bit longer and dug deep into his bio, routines, philosophies, and suggestions. This one is much shorter -- think of it as philosophical steroids. It may take a few minutes to get into, so be patient. Here, you'll find pithy, actionable things that you can implement, such has how to keep track of the right things and how to create a narrative that serves you best. It's very simple, but it's a foundational skill and mindset that I try to practice myself. This was a fantastic reminder. Please enjoy round two with Seth Godin!

        Mike Birbiglia (@birbigs) is one of the best-known and busiest working comedians in the world, both behind and in front of the camera. His standup blends elements of theater, film, storytelling, and comedy. Mike has been deliberate in studying many crafts and tying them together, which is reflected in a diverse string of successes: sold-out tours as a solo theater act, New York Times bestselling books, off-Broadway shows, feature film, TV, and more. In recent years, his work has appeared on public radio's This American Life, where he began a meaningful collaboration with host and producer Ira Glass. Currently, he is the creator, writer, and star of the new film Don't Think Twice, which was just released. I loved it, which I do not say lightly. Check it out. So...how the hell does he do it all? I aimed to find out. In this conversation, we cover a ton, including:  His writing process and schedule Favorite books, documentaries, and TV shows Morning routines Stories and lessons from Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, and others How he "workshops" and develops material Hilarious interactions with POTUS The best pizza joints in NYC Which three comedians he'd combine into one "super comic" How he runs jokes by other people And much, much more...

        This episode is a little different. I visited the Googleplex -- the Mountain View-based headquarters of Google -- and had a public chat. I was interviewed and made sure that we covered some ground that has not been discussed before. There were questions such as:  What has been the most important Stoic teaching that I've come across? How do I manage the many requests I receive? What are the factors or elements that have led to the success of the podcast? Where do I see myself in five years? If I could pick three people -- alive or dead -- to be in my personal board of directors, who would they be? How do I experiment with my dog training? What are my recommendations for longevity? How do I fight insomnia? And much, much more...  As always, I hope you enjoy this episode and find it useful.

        Nicholas McCarthy (@NMcCarthyPiano) was born in 1989 without his right hand and only started to play the piano at the age of 14. He was told he would never succeed as a concert pianist. Fortunately, the doubters were wrong. His graduation from the prestigious Royal College of Music in London in 2012 appeared in press around the world, as he became the only one-handed pianist to graduate from the Royal College of Music in its 130-year history. Nicholas has now performed extensively throughout the world, including the U.K., U.S., South Africa, South Korea, Japan, Malta, and Kazakhstan. He has also played alongside Coldplay and given a rendition of the Paralympic Anthem in front of an audience of 86,000 people and half a billion worldwide viewers. His first album, entitled Solo (Warner Music) features 17 stunning pieces of left-hand repertoire spanning three centuries and has been released around the world to great acclaim.

        Chris Young is an obsessive tinkerer, inventor, and innovator. His areas of expertise range from extreme aviation (world-record goals) to mathematics and apocalyptic-scale BBQs. Above all, he is one of the clearest thinkers I know. In this interview, we discuss a great many things, including his wild story and lessons learned from rainmakers like Bill Gates, Gabe Newell, Neal Stephenson, and many more. More topics we tackle:  How he managed to get jobs working for the best in the world...despite having no credentials. Advice -- and incredible questions -- from self-made billionaires. Why raw foodism isn't always what it's cracked up to be. How geniuses show disappointment and ensure you correct yourself. The "emoji egg" breakfast. And much more...

        Dr. Dominic "Dom" D'Agostino (@DominicDAgosti2) is an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, and a senior research scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC). He has also deadlifted 500 pounds for 10 reps after a seven-day fast. Many of you sent enthusiastic follow-up questions after the last conversation we had, so Dom took the time to answer your most popular questions. In particular, he focused on ketosis, ketones, and the ketogenic diet -- so you can consider it the ketosis master class (especially if you combine both episodes, though this one does stand alone). It takes a few minutes for Dom to warm up -- so be patient! If you have an interest in these types of metabolic therapies, whether for performance enhancement, endurance, weight loss, or fighting cancer, diabetes, or any number of other maladies, you will find a gem within this episode.

It goes in many different directions, but I think you'll enjoy it.

        This episode is actually a workshop on negotiating. Out of all the resources out there on how to negotiate, 99 percent of them are piss-poor -- but I guarantee you this isn't one of them. The teacher is Ramit Sethi. These lessons are all taken from a multi-day course Ramit taught on CreativeLive.com, which is one of the fastest growing startups. [Full disclosure: I am an advisor.] If you are an entrepreneur, perhaps just getting into entrepreneurship, thinking of taking the dive into entrepreneurship, or you just want to get out of a trap of your own making, I think you'll find a lot here. Pay a lot of attention to the exact scripting that Ramit uses. And if a particular section isn't clicking with you, just skip ahead 20 minutes or so and you'll find yourself in a new lesson. In this episode, you will learn about:  Positioning Smart negotiation vs. dumb negotiation Overcoming mental barriers related to entrepreneurship What you should charge or how you should think about charging for your services Mock interviews And much, much more  Enjoy!

        My job is usually to deconstruct world-class performers from business, military, entertainment, politics, or athletics, and then to tease out the routines and habits you can use. In this particular episode, I'm going to share an overarching strategy that has been used by many of the greats. That includes Ben Franklin, legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, and many, many more. It is also how I built my network, how my first book hit the tipping point, how I became successful at angel investing, and the list goes on. Of course, if you're interested in the networking part of it, you can also read the blog post and listen to the episode, How to Build a World-Class Network in Record Time. But that is additional credit. The secret to all of the above is the "canvas strategy." And in this episode, Ryan Holiday, author of the new book, Ego Is the Enemy, will teach you how to apply canvas strategy to your life.

        Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) is a legendary figure in Silicon Valley -- and worldwide. Even in the epicenter of tech, it's hard to find a more fascinating icon. Marc co-created the highly influential Mosaic Internet browser, the first widely used graphical web browser. He also co-founded Netscape, which later sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. Then he co-founded Loudcloud, which sold as Opsware to Hewlett Packard for $1.6 billion. He's considered one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet, right alongside pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, who launched the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and early HTML standards. This all makes him one of the few humans ever to create software categories used by more than a billion people. He's also one of the few who's established multiple billion-dollar companies. Marc is now co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, where he's quickly become one of the most influential and dominant tech investors in the world. In this interview, we dig into some fun things Marc has not discussed in many places, including:  His epic debate vs. Peter Thiel Rules for investing The future of bitcoin Artificial intelligence Favorite books, documentaries, and movies And much, much more  We had an extremely detailed and rich conversation, and I hope you enjoy it.

Dubner and his team at Freakonomics.com, on Twitter, or you can subscribe to their show on iTunes. Without further preamble, please enjoy this wide-ranging and sometimes-weird conversation with Stephen J. Dubner! Enjoy!

This is the training system that I am most obsessed with at the moment. Coach Sommer appeared on a previous episode of the podcast, which turned into a sleeper hit. He is the former USA national team coach for men's gymnastics and creator of this bodyweight-based training system. I'm not easily impressed, and I have been completely blown away by the sophistication and the elegance of his programming. I have been using Gymnastic Bodies for just a few months now, and I already feel more flexible and stronger than I have in years.

        If you want a better understanding of warriors, tribal societies, human nature, and what we can learn from it all, this is for you. My podcast guest is Sebastian Junger (@sebastianjunger), the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The Perfect Storm, Fire, A Death in Belmont, War, and Tribe.  As an award-winning journalist, a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, and a special correspondent at ABC News, he has covered major international news stories around the world and has received both a National Magazine Award and a Peabody Award. Junger is also a documentary filmmaker whose debut film "Restrepo," a feature-length documentary (co-directed with Tim Hetherington), was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. "Restrepo," which chronicled the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley, is widely considered to have broken new ground in war reporting.  Junger has since produced and directed three additional documentaries about war and its aftermath. In this episode, we cover rites of passage (and their importance), warfare, the art of great non-fiction writing, PTSD, evolutionary biology, and much more. Some of the topics will no doubt offend many of you, and this is a good thing. I urge you to bite your lip, if need be, and listen to the entire episode. There are gems within, including hilarious stories, surprising statistics, and tear-jerking epiphanies. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        Alex Honnold (@alexhonnold, Facebook: /alexhonnold) is a professional adventure rock climber whose audacious free-solo (no ropes, no partner) ascents of America’s biggest cliffs have made him one of the most recognized and followed climbers in the world. Honnold is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control his fear while scaling cliffs of dizzying heights without a rope to protect him if he falls. His most celebrated achievements include the first and only free-solos of the Moonlight Buttress (5.12d, 1,200 feet) in Zion National Park, Utah, and the Northwest Face (5.12a) of Half Dome (2,200 feet), Yosemite, California. In 2012, he achieved Yosemite’s first “Triple Solo”: climbing, in succession, the National Park’s three largest faces—Mt. Watkins, Half Dome and El Capitan—alone, and in under 24 hours. He is also the founder of the Honnold Foundation, an environmental non-profit, and to this day, he maintains his simple “dirtbag-climber” existence, living out of his van and traveling the world in search of the next great vertical adventure.

        If you loved the Pavel, Poliquin, or Dom D’Agostino episodes, you'll love this one. My guest this episode isChristopher Sommer (GymnasticBodies on Instagram/Facebook), former US national team gymnastics coach. He is also the founder of GymnasticBodies, a training system that I’m currently testing (and have no affiliation with). As a world-renowned Olympic coach, Sommer is known for building his students into some of the strongest, most powerful athletes in the world. During his extensive 40-year coaching career, Coach Sommer took meticulous notes on his training techniques—his wins and failures—so that he could translate the best elements into a superior exercise system for both high-level and beginner athletes. His four decades of careful observation led to the birth of Gymnastics Strength Training™ (or GST). In this episode, we cover A TON, including:  The 3-5 exercises everyone should be doing (you’ve never heard of some of them) His opinions of kipping exercises, such as the kipping pull-ups common in CrossFit What bodyweight goals non-gymnasts should target Which exercises to remove from the gym entirely, at least in the first 6-12 months of training How to optimize biceps strength and mass with straight-arm work And much, much more...  I also asked Coach Sommer to gather some interesting stuff (samples, videos, etc.) at gymnasticbodies.com/tim, so take a gander. I don’t get any compensation for any of it; I just want people to consider more bodyweight training. I’ve found it revelatory and mind-expanding. Enjoy!

        "Just because you love something doesn’t mean you can’t suck at it." - Mike Rowe Mike Rowe (@mikeroweworks) is perhaps the best storyteller and pitchman I've ever had on the show. You may know Mike Rowe as the host of Dirty Jobs. Mike Rowe is a TV host, writer, narrator, producer, actor and spokesman. His performing career began in 1984 when he faked his way into the Baltimore Opera to get his union card and meet girls, both of which he accomplished during a performance of Rigoletto. His transition to television occurred in 1990 when — to settle a bet — he auditioned for the QVC Shopping Channel and was promptly hired after talking about a pencil for nearly eight minutes. There, he worked the graveyard shift for three years, until he was ultimately fired for making fun of products and belittling viewers. Why listen to this episode? You will learn:   Secrets of the perfect pitch   How Mike flew around the world for free (until he got caught)   Why to pursue opportunity instead of passion   How being different can help you win in business and life  The business of Mike Rowe Favorite books, voice-over artists, and much, much more...

        "A successful writing day is the day that I suffer in the morning, and I have fun in the evening." -Paulo Coelho Paulo Coelho (@paulocoelho) has long been one of my writing inspirations. His books, of near universal appeal, spans from The Alchemist to the most recent Adultery and has been translated into more than 70 languages. Few people know that The Alchemist, which has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide, was originally published by a small Brazilian publisher to the tune of... 900 copies. They declined to reprint it. It wasn't until after his subsequent novel (Brida) that The Alchemist was revived and took off. I, for one, have always been impressed with consistent writers. Paulo, who averages one book every two years, is staggeringly consistent. As I type this, I am under the pressure of deadlines and often feel as Kurt Vonnegut did: "When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth." My output is erratic at best, and I wondered: how does Paulo write? What is his process? How does he think about it? I reached out to him, and he was kind enough to reply with the audio I've included in the podcast. In it, he provides some gems and answers.  Enjoy!

        At the end of our lives, what do we most wish for? And how can knowing this help you live better lives now? BJ Miller, MD (@zenhospice) knows. BJ is a palliative care physician at Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco, where he thinks deeply about how to create a dignified, graceful end of life for his patients. He is an expert in death, but he’s also learned how we can dramatically improve our own lives, often with very small changes. When you consider that he has guided or been involved with ~1,000 deaths, it’s not surprising that he’s spotted patterns we can all learn from. BJ is also a triple amputee, and his 2015 TED Talk, "Not Whether But How," is a moving reflection on his vision to make empathic end-of-life care available to all, ranked among the top-15 most viewed TED talks of the year. If you want to know what being around death can teach you about living, you'll want to listen to this. I LOVED this conversation, and I hope you do as well.  Enjoy.

        Whenever I succumb to social pressure to treat time as less valuable than income, that's when I turn to stoicism. In this special episode of the podcast, I'm sharing one of my favorite letters from Seneca, "On Philosophy and Riches." This is a must-listen for anyone obsessed with increasing wealth or material possessions. My favorite portion begins with, "I might close my letter at this point." If you want to learn more of Seneca's teachings, I've compiled his letters into a collection called the Tao of Seneca. Enjoy!

        Caroline Paul (@carowriter) is a blast and can also probably kick my ass... seriously. Caroline is the author of four published books. Her latest is the New York Times best seller The Gutsy Girl: Escapades for Your Life of Epic Adventure. Once a young scaredy-cat, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of the life she wanted--of excitement, confidence, and self-reliance. She has since flown planes, rafted big rivers, climbed tall mountains, and fought fires as one of the first female firefighters in San Francisco. In this episode, we discuss various types of fear and how to overcome them, using stories, habits, and tactics. Enjoy!  This podcast is brought to you by Wealthfront.

        This is an interview you’ve been asking for since before I started the podcast: Morgan Spurlock.  Morgan Spurlock (@morganspurlock) is an Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker based in New York. He is a prolific writer, director, producer, and human guinea pig. His first film, Super Size Me, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004, winning Best Directing honors. The film went on to win the Writers Guild of America Best Documentary Screenplay award as well as garner an Academy Award nomination for Best Feature Documentary. Since then he has directed, produced, and distributed multiple film, TV and digital projects, including the critically acclaimed CNN series Morgan Spurlock Inside Man, the FX series 30 Days, and the films Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden?, Confessions of a Superhero, Freakonomics, The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, and many others. Morgan’s latest project is a tech startup called Clect (homepage, AngelList profile), which is a community for the high-spending collectors community with a one-stop marketplace where people can browse, sell, and buy collectibles of any type imaginable (Star Wars, Smurfs, Comics, a Millennium Falcon made from motorcycle parts, etc.). Imagine Comic-Con meets Pinterest and eBay. In this episode, we cover a ton:  How Morgan got his biggest breaks and, in some cases, made his own luck How he builds rapport with people and gets them to open up Tips for aspiring creators and filmmakers How to get people to care about important issues Favorite books, documentaries, movies, etc. Morgan’s thoughts on the future of media and storytelling  Enjoy!

        I once wrote, "We all like to appear 'successful' (a nebulous term at best) and the media likes to portray standouts as superheroes...Most 'superheroes' are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk." Focusing on what people accomplish without understanding the mindset that allows them to experience that success leads to limited results. To help close the gap, I wanted to share On The Shortness of Life by Seneca the Younger. It's a short letter written roughly two thousand years ago, yet it's timeliness. This is an essay that I revisit at least once a quarter because it focuses on how much time we're given in life, and how it's oftentimes misused or wasted. You can listen to my favorite portion here, which begins with:  "Why do you torment yourself and lose weight over some problem..."  This is a fantastic reminder to mind the critical few and to ignore the trivial many. You can listen to this one and the rest of the collection via the Tao of Seneca at Audible.com/TimsBooks. Enjoy!

        Ever since episode #2 of the podcast, you’ve been asking for more Josh Waitzkin, so here it is! This is an in-depth jam session, and you can definitely listen to this one independently. Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. Considered a chess prodigy, he has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian jiu-jitsu (he’s a black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia) and Tai Chi push hands (he’s a world champion). These days, he spends his time coaching the world’s top performers, whether Mark Messier, Cal Ripken Jr., or high-profile investors. I initially met Josh through his incredible book, The Art of Learning, which I loved so much that I helped produce the audiobook (download here at Audible). If you're interested in implementing programs designed by Josh in your classroom, go to theartoflearningproject.org and find out if the program is a good fit for you. This episode is DEEP, in the best way possible. Just like last time, Josh will blow your mind. Enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

Of course you have, and that’s where MeUndies comes in.

        Today's episode is a bite-sized morsel for your brain and for your life. This is an excerpt from my favorite writing of all time. This letter is #22, "On the Futility of Halfway Measures." As usual, Seneca takes a little time in his preamble to get warmed up. That is his style. He seems to enjoy feeling out the recipient of his letter before jumping into the details. I love this letter because it addresses how we spend our time, which is one of the biggest stresses for all people, and especially entrepreneurs. My favorite portion is:  "Hence men leave such advantages as these with reluctance."  I encourage you to listen to this and think of ways that you can adapt Seneca's wisdom to your own life. Enjoy!

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-181">
        This episode is very special to me and features a verbal Jedi who never gets interviewed himself: Cal Fussman. Cal (@calfussman) is a New York Times bestselling author and a writer-at-large for Esquire Magazine, where he is best known for being a primary writer of the “What I Learned” feature. The Austin Chronicle has described Cal's interviewing skills as "peerless." He has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with the icons who’ve shaped the last 50 years of world history: Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, Jack Welch, Robert DeNiro, Clint Eastwood, Al Pacino, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen, Dr. Dre, Quincy Jones, Woody Allen, Barbara Walters, Pelé, Yao Ming, Serena Williams, John Wooden, Muhammad Ali, and countless others. Born in Brooklyn, Cal  spent 10 straight years traveling the world, swimming over 18-foot tiger sharks, rolling around with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and searching for gold in the Amazon. He has also made himself a guinea pig — Cal has boxed against world champion Julio Cesar Chavez and served as a sommelier atop of the World Trade Center. He now lives with his wife—whom he met while on a quest to discover the world’s most beautiful beach—and his three children in Los Angeles, where he spends every morning eating breakfast with Larry King.

        If you've enjoyed my previous in-between episodes , then this might be your favorite episode ever. It's one of the most actionable, information-packed interviews I've ever done. This time, it's Joel Stein (@TheJoelStein) asking the questions. Joel is one of the funniest writers I have ever read, and he's great at leading an interview. Here's how it all happened: Joel wanted me to help him figure out 5 areas he could improve for an upcoming series he was going to create. I have many different conversations with journalists. It can be painful when I have a 1-2 hour conversation, and then it's cut to a single sentence as a quote in a piece. And it's often a misquote. So how do you fix that? Well, you record it yourself, which is what we did. (With Joel's approval, of course.) This way, you don't "lose" the content, and you cover your ass with media and journalists. In this episode, we discuss a wide variety of topics, including:  How I choose what to improve from infinite options How you can subtract your way to success The genius of Ben Franklin Why self-improvement doesn't mean self-centered How I say no to time-consuming lunches, coffees, and other meetings How I tackle cold introductions How I surmounted Lyme Disease My 100% complete break from start-ups (read this for more) My podcast process Tools and tactics for reversing email overwhelm  Enjoy!

        At the behest of my astute legal counsel, here is a legal disclaimer for this episode: First, I am not recommending, endorsing, or supporting any of the substances or compounds (especially illegal) discussed or described in the interview. I am interviewing Patrick Arnold as a journalist seeking additional information regarding matters of public interest and concern. Second, I have removed some of the names of athletes who are alleged to have used performance enhancing drugs. I recognize that this seems excessive, but even if athletes have been publicly banned for drug usage, unless the ban relates to the specific substance and time period referenced in the podcast, I can be sued for defamation for repeating or publicizing these stories. With all that said, here we go...  If you liked my episode with Dom D'Agostino, you might love this one. Patrick Arnold, widely considered “the father of prohormones," is an organic chemist known for introducing androstenedione (remember Mark McGwire?), 1-Androstenediol (marketed as “1-AD”), and methylhexanamine into the dietary supplement market. He also created the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone, best known as THG and "the clear." THG, along with two other anabolic steroids that Patrick manufactured (best known: norbolethone), were not banned at the time of their creation. They were hard-to-detect drugs at the heart of the BALCO professional sports doping scandal, which thrust Barry Bonds and others into the spotlight. BALCO distributed these worldwide to world-class athletes in a wide variety of sports, ranging from track and field to professional baseball and football. Recently, Patrick has been innovating in the legal world of ketone supplementation, including breakthroughs in performance and taste with products like KetoForce and KetoCaNa, which were highlighted during my podcast with Dominic D'Agostino, PhD. If you'd like to meet the (in)famous Patrick Arnold in person, you can find him at The Arnold Classic in Colombus, Ohio from March 3-6, 2016 at Booth 328. Otherwise, you can check out his current concoctions for athletes here and here. In this science-dense conversation, we cover a ton, mostly related to better performance through chemistry. We also discuss Patrick's biggest successes and mistakes, his path to science, ursolic acid and other clever creations, exogenous ketone supplementation for sports, as well as nonsense in the media about anabolics (e.g. current Delta-2 scandal).

        This episode is a special double header. It features one interview and one performance. First up is Kaskade (@Kaskade), widely considered one of the Founding Fathers of Progressive House Music. He's been voted "America's Best DJ" twice by DJ Times, headlined Coachella 4x, and been nominated for Grammys 5x. Next, you'll hear Sekou Andrews (@SekouAndrews), the most impressive poetic voice I've ever heard. I first saw him perform at TED, where he blew my mind. Sekou is a schoolteacher turned 2x National Poetry Slam champion. He has presented privately for Barack Obama, Bono, Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou, as well as for many Fortune 500 companies. Each one of these takes a few minutes to get warmed up, so be patient. There are gems in both. Among other things...  Kaskade covers his first breaks, making his own luck, formative musical influences, and we dig into his notetaking process, and the origins of one of his biggest hits. Sekou will inspire you to be inspired by your story. Do you want to change your narrative, your internal dialogue, to be more successful? Do you need to get back on the horse, or have an effective pep talk in your back pocket?  This might be the recording you listen to over and over again. There is a lot of practical philosophy embedded in and between the lines, so listen to it all. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        "My parents never really told me I couldn't do anything." - Shaun White This particular episode comes from a fun event -- my first live podcast at the iconic Troubadour in L.A.

Just go to fourhourworkweek.com/friday. There were quite a few amazing guests at the event, and we're going to divide them up into a few episodes.

He holds the X Games record for gold medals at 15, as well as the highest overall medal count at 24. Shaun has earned the number two spot on BusinessWeek's list of the 100 most powerful and marketable athletes. And -- ACH-TUNG! -- for those near L.A. or willing to travel, Shaun is hosting an incredible event called Air + Style.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-187">
        This episode might make your head explode... in the best way possible. Walter O'Brien (AKA "Scorpion") (@walterobrienscs) is the founder of Scorpion Computer Services and ConciergeUp.com, a for-hire global think tank that provides intelligence-on-demand as a concierge service. The tag line for the latter is, "for any funded need."  Need to defend against chemical warfare? Move an entire manufacturing operation over a weekend?  Save a loved one from a deceitful spouse?  Thread the needle on a thorny legal issue? Become a pop star in a foreign country?  When Walter and his team of 2,000+ distributed geniuses say "any funded need," they mean it literally. Born in Ireland, Walter was diagnosed as a child prodigy with an IQ of 197. He became an Irish national coding champion and competed in the Olympics in informatics. Fast forward to today, he and Scorpion get paid to fix every imaginable problem for billionaires, startups, governments, Fortune 500 companies, and people like you and me. On the large side, it ranges from mitigating risk on $1.9 trillion of investments to inventing artificial intelligence engines to protect United States war fighters in Afghanistan. Walter is also the executive producer of the hit CBS TV show Scorpion, inspired by his life, which has reached more than 26 million television viewers. I was introduced to Walter well before the show, and we go deep in this conversation, with lots of amazing and also hilarious examples of problem solving. Enjoy!

This podcast is also brought to you by Boll and Branch. There is a lot of nonsense in the bedding business. For instance, did you know thread-count is not a good measurement of quality? It's a total myth. The "Made in Italy" label? It isn't something you should necessarily pay extra for because it generally means it's just finished in Italy and woven in places like China. The general industry mark-up for bedding is 700 to 800 percent at most retailers. Boll and Branch create incredibly high-quality bedding. They are the same sheets you'll find at my home in San Francisco. The best part? You can try anything you order at home for 30 days. If you don't love it, send it back and get a full refund. Go to Boll and Branch and use promo code "TIM" for 20% off your entire order. Whether sheets, towels, blankets, duvet covers, or anything else. Shipping is always free.

        I expected this episode to be amazing, and Seth 10x'd expectations. He's incredible. Seth Godin (@thisissethsblog) is the author of 17 bestselling books that have been translated into more than 35 languages. He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing, strategic quitting, leadership, and--most of all--challenging the status quo in all areas. His books include Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip, Purple Cow, and What to do When it's Your Turn (And it's Always Your Turn). Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. His blog (which you can find by typing “Seth” into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. In 2013, Godin was inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame. Recently, Godin turned the book publishing world on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal in just three hours and became the most successful book project in Kickstarter history. In this episode, we cover dozens of topics and stories, including some he's never discussed publicly before. Here's a small sample:  A list of the audiobooks he listens to repeatedly, some once per month His morning routine, breakfast, dietary habits, and email processing Meditative practices Why he's fixated on and mastered coffee and vodka, despite the fact that he consumes neither Suggestions for going from "wantrepreneur" to entrepreneur How to determine if you're better off a "freelancer" or "entrepreneur," and the differences in his mind Why he has the most impressive cookbook collection our mutual chef friends have ever seen His rules for saying "no" to opportunities, how he thinks about public speaking, etc. His recipe for honey oatmeal vodka, and his favorite chocolates in the world Thoughts on improving how parents educate their children General philosophies and guidelines he uses for life management  Enjoy!

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-192">
        This is a special episode that is the result of more than 10 years of dreaming. For years, I've been studying Stoicism, but I've always had a particular interest in The Tao of Seneca. What is the Tao of Seneca? There's a collection of letters called, "The Moral Letters to Lucilius." And I have read this entire collection of letters and other letters of Seneca, the author, probably more than 100 times. It has been my constant companion for at least the last 10 years. And I have given various forms of these letters to more friends than I can even count and several hundred acquaintances -- I feel that strongly about it. So when people ask me about my favorite book, I say this collection of letters. The problem has been there is no good audio edition. So I, for many months now, have made this my passion project to create The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master. Three volumes, and it covers them all. Here's the description: The Tao of Seneca is an introduction to the stoic philosophy through the words of Seneca. Thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of stoicism, and NFL management (coaches and players, alike) have embraced it because the principles make them better competitors. This episode features letter #13, "On Groundless Fears." Stoicism is a no-nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real-world effects. Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments. This is your guide. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        This episode, I sit down with Edward Norton (@EdwardNorton). Edward is an actor, filmmaker and activist. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards for his work in Primal Fear, American History X, and Birdman. He has starred in scores of other films, including Fight Club, The Illusionist, and Moonrise Kingdom. Unbeknownst to most people, Edward is also a serial startup founder (e.g. CrowdRise; here’s my current campaign), a UN ambassador for biodiversity, a massively successful investor (e.g. early Uber), a pilot, and deeply involved with wilderness conservation. In this conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including:  His beginnings in acting, and what early mentors taught him What separates great actors from mediocre actors, as illustrated through an early Marlon Brando story  Edward’s physical preparation for American History X (and camera trickery) The importance of surfing His favorite books, documentaries, underrated films and filmmakers, and essays (The Catastrophe of Success, etc.) His advice to his 20- and 30-year old self And much more...  And here’s a bonus, another favorite book he remembered after we stopped recording: Buddhism Without Beliefs. Enjoy!

        Sometimes one interview just isn't enough. That was certainly the case with my good friend, Chris Sacca. Chris (who I interviewed before) was recently the cover story of the Midas Issue of Forbes magazine. He was on the cover because he's a newly minted billionaire and the proprietor of what will likely be the most successful venture capital fund in history: LOWERCASE Capital. He's an early-stage investor in companies like Twitter, Uber, Instagram, Kickstarter, and many more. Also, he wears cowboy shirts, has a great beard, and is hilarious, which is reason enough to bring him back for more. In this episode, he answers all of your most pressing questions based on your votes and feedback.s You'll find some fantastic responses, ranging from life advice to business recommendations and everything in between. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This episode is brought to you by Foodist Kitchen. Sometimes the most life-changing habits are the ones we put off, and learning to cook is at the top of that list. I only finally took the plunge when writing The 4-Hour Chef, and it turned my eating and my life into high definition. Foodist Kitchen is a 30-day program that teaches you how to cook without recipes, and I highly recommend it. Chopping and sautéing are just a small part of the whole deal -- you also need to know what flavors taste good together and what it means to cook until done. Foodist Kitchen brings all these skills together so you can walk into the kitchen, open the fridge, and have an intuitive sense of what to cook and how to do it. It was created by Darya Rose, who's a friend of mine and one of my cooking mentors for The 4-Hour Chef. She has offered a $15 discount off your membership, so check out FoodistKitchen.com/Tim to learn more about the program. This episode is also brought to you by Exo Protein. These guys are making protein bars using cricket protein powder. Before you screw your face up and look disgusted, I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before! With recipes that were developed by a three-Michelin-starred chef, the bars are paleo-friendly, with no gluten, no grains, no soy, no dairy, etc., and they won't pop up your glycemic response. In fact, they're less processed than any other protein bars you'll be able to find. Exo Protein is offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss Show listeners -- if you go to ExoProtein.com/Tim today, you can try a sampler pack with all of the most popular flavors for less than $10. This is a startup with limited inventory that sells out all the time, so act fast!

He’s brilliant and hilarious. If you enjoyed my podcasts with Derek Sivers or Sam Harris, you’ll love this one. We cover a lot of ground, including:  Living from first principles rather than the “consensus reality" The genius of Kung Fu Panda What it’s like working with Peter Thiel, and how Peter hired him How to innovate when you risk being crucified by close-minded communities (and experts) His favorite books Why one of his favorite documentaries is about pornographers And much more...

        Derek Sivers (@sivers) is one of my favorite humans, and I call him often for advice. Think of him as a philosopher-king programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. Originally a professional musician and circus clown, Derek created CD Baby in 1998. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100 million in sales for 150,000 musicians. In 2008, Derek sold CD Baby for $22 million, giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education. By popular demand, this is round 2 with the amazing Derek Sivers! This episode can be listened to independently of our previous conversation, which can be found at fourhourworkweek.com/derek ### This podcast is brought to you by Mizzen + Main.

        Amelia Boone (@ameliaboone) has been called the Michael Jordan of obstacle course racing (OCR). This episode explores her training, nutrition, rehab, "pre-hab", and more. In a sense, Amelia is more impressive than MJ, as she conquered OCR while building a stellar full-time career in law. Since the sport’s inception, she’s amassed more than 30 victories and 50 podiums. In the 2012 World's Toughest Mudder competition, which lasted 24 hours, she finished 2nd OVERALL out of 1,000+ competitors. This was ahead of every male except the winner, who beat her by just 8 minutes. Her major victories include the Spartan Race World Championship (2013), Spartan Race Series Point Champion (2013 and 2015), and she is the only three-time winner of the World's Toughest Mudder (2012, 2014 and 2015). She won the 2014 WTM eight weeks after knee surgery. Amelia is also a three-time finisher of the Death Race, and dabbles in ultra-running in all of her spare time. Phew... I'm exhausted just writing this intro, but Amelia can do it all while eating Pop-Tarts for breakfast (seriously).

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-202">
        This episode is one of my favorite I've ever done. Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) is an Academy Award-winning actor, a Grammy Award-winning musician, and a famous standup and improv comedian. He is, without a doubt, the most consummate performer and entertainer I have ever met.  In the 2.5 hours we spent together in his home studio, he blew my mind. We cover a TON in this wide-ranging episode, including many never-before-heard stories. Here's just a tiny sample of what you'll hear:   Jamie's workout routine Jamie's origin story -- how he used $400 to match a $1,000,000 party thrown by Puff Daddy; building up his network with Kanye, Jay Z, and Pharrell; expanding his fan base; and bombing horribly at the beginning. What he learned during the magic of In Living Color Jamie playing live music throughout our interview. Impersonations (and lessons learned from many of the following) -- Quincy Jones, Ed Sheeran, Ray Charles, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Cosby, Doc Rivers, Kermit the Frog, Sammy Davis, Jr., LeBron James, Bill Clinton, Tamara Rawitt, Shawn Wayans, Jim Carrey, Oprah Winfrey, Norman Lear, Mike Tyson, and others. The key skills Jamie learned from his grandmother. Jamie's parenting style. And much, much more...

        This is another special episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. Usually, when I talk about strategies for living a better life, I focus on strategies for effectiveness and efficiency. That is, finding ways for you to be better without wasting time. Both of these are important, but fine-tuning those traits come naturally for me. Mindfulness is something that is difficult and usually overlooked by most people. So why is mindfulness essential? When it comes to achievement, most people just work harder. In reality, you want to first achieve more focus and clarity, which can help guide your effort. This is the real benefit of mindfulness. Once you incorporate it into your life, you complain less, appreciate more, react less, and fill your life with what's most important to you. More than anything, you'll learn how to be present and live in the moment. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

He has also cofounded two well-known non-profits: 80,000 Hours, which provides research and advice on how you can best make a difference through your career, and Giving What We Can, which encourages people to commit to give at least 10% of their income to the most effective charities. Between them, they have raised more than $450 million in lifetime pledged donations, and are in the top 1% of non-profits in terms of growth. He is one of the few non-profit founders who have gone through Y Combinator; for-profit companies get $120,000 for 7% of equity; as a non-profit, 80,000 Hours got $100,000 for 0% of equity. In this episode, we discuss his story and a ton of actionable tips, including:  Why "following your passion" in a career is often a mistake. Thought experiments: Pascal's Wager versus Pascal's Mugging Why working for a non-profit straight out of college is also a mistake. How it's possible to "hack" doing good in the same way you would a business. Implications of artificial intelligence. The best ways to really evaluate if you (or charities) are going good in the world. The reasons donating to disaster relief typically isn't the best use of your money. Why ethical consumerism typically isn't a great way to do good. Running a non-profit in the Harvard/Navy SEALs of startup incubators: Y Combinator  This podcast is brought to you by Wealthfront.

        Kevin Costner (@modernwest) is an internationally renowned filmmaker. He is considered one of the most critically acclaimed and visionary storytellers of his generation. Costner has produced, directed, and/or starred in such memorable films such as Dances with Wolves, JFK, The Bodyguard, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, Bull Durham, Open Range, Hatfields & McCoys, and Black or White, among many others. He has been honored with two Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and an Emmy Award. This episode also features Jon Baird, the author and illustrator of the novels Day Job and Songs from Nowhere Near the Heart. He is the co-developer, along with Costner, of the Horizon miniseries. Their first book collaboration is a beautiful tome -- The Explorers Guild: A Passage to Shambhala. Kirkus described it: "With its colorful cast, exotic locales, and intertwined fates, the book slowly addicts. A rousing throwback whose spinning plates never stop, even at the end."

        Alain de Botton (@alaindebotton) is many things, but I think of him as a rare breed of practical philosopher. In 1997, he turned away from writing novels and instead wrote an extended essay titled How Proust Can Change Your Life, which became an unlikely blockbuster. His subsequent books have been described as a ‘philosophy of everyday life’ and subjects include love, travel, architecture, religion and work. His other bestsellers include Essays In Love, Status Anxiety, and The Architecture Of Happiness. More recent works include The News: A User’s Manual, which looks at the impact our obsession with checking news has on our minds, and Art as Therapy, co-written with the art historian John Armstrong. In 2008, de Botton helped start The School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today's uptight culture. His goal is (through any of his mediums) to help clients learn "how to live wisely and well." In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover many things, including:  Real-world versus academic philosophy The value of rituals and tribes Practical pessimism "Ordinary genius" The magic of pomegranates Lesser-known modern thinkers Why "mean" is often simply "anxious" His favorite Japanese pens And much more!

The primary focus of Dom's laboratory is developing and testing metabolic therapies, including ketogenic diets, ketone esters and ketone supplements to induce nutritional/therapeutic ketosis. D’Agostino’s laboratory uses in vivo and in vitro techniques to understand the physiological, cellular and molecular mechanism of metabolic therapies and nutritional strategies for peak performance and resilience.

        Jimmy Chin (@jimkchin) is an artist and professional athlete, often at the same time. If Chase Jarvis and Laird Hamilton had a love child, it would be Jimmy.  He has participated in and documented breakthrough expeditions around the planet, from climbing first ascents in the Karakoram to skiing first descents in the Himalayas. He is one of the few people to both climb Mount Everest and ski it from the summit.  Most recently, he filmed and directed the incredible feature documentary MERU, which is in theaters now and won the 2015 Audience Award at Sundance. What is MERU? In the high-stakes game of big-wall climbing, the Shark’s Fin on Mount Meru is the ultimate prize. Everest is a cakewalk by comparison. Sitting at the headwaters of the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the Shark’s Fin has seen more failed attempts by elite climbing teams over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the Himalayas. This movie is the story of one group’s journey to conquer it—a white-knuckle quest of friendship, sacrifice, hope and obsession. How Jimmy captured it on film while risking his life is almost impossible to fathom. In this episode of the podcast, we talk about his origins, training, nutrition, gear, and MERU, of course. Suffice to say, if you want a benevolent kick in the ass, the film MERU is your assignment. I saw it a few weeks ago, and all my family could say for minutes afterward was, “Whoa….” My refrain was, “Holy shit…,” which I muttered to myself at least 20 times in 90 minutes.  It’s an amazing, terrifying, and inspiring edge-of-your-seat experience.

        "I should be used as a mercenary, not a lifer." - Tim Ferriss In this episode, we have a change of pace... Expa (@expa) is a startup studio. It was founded by Garrett Camp, who co-founded Uber. Every once in a blue moon, they put together a night of education. I was invited to participate. In this episode, I discuss the topic of startup design vs. lifestyle design. Some of you may be aware that I've been involved with various startups ranging from Uber to Facebook, Twitter and DuoLingo, and other businesses that have grown to more than 100 million users and customers. Simultaneously, I have written many times about lifestyle design, and I've suggested that it should come before career planning. The question is, how do we reconcile these two different approaches to business? Should you focus on building your muse and creating cash-flow focused business to fuel your ideal lifestyle...or should you swing for the fences and bet it all on a startup that is equity driven? This podcast explores these topics -- and many more -- and aims to answer the questions that I think are under-examined.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-217">
        Richard Betts (@yobetts) served as the wine director at The Little Nell in Aspen from 2000 to 2008. Much more interesting to me, Richard passed the Court of Master Sommeliers' Masters Exam on his first attempt, becoming the ninth person in history ever to do so. I first met Richard through investing wunderkind Chris Sacca, and we immediately hit it off. Richard can help you train your senses for anything, including wine, whiskey, his current love of mezcal, and far beyond. He's also done a lot of wild experiments, got a lot of tattoos, almost been shot in Mexico, and developed an incredible ability to simplify the complex. We get along. In this conversation, we talk about nearly everything, ranging from the value of quitting to tricks of the trade, travel tips (he's traveling 300+ days per year), and "starter" wines. We also drink a boat-load of whiskey, me tasting and Richard teaching. The pictures below show a sample. Side note and cool rule of thumb: did you know it's spelled "whiskey" when from countries that have "e" in their names (e.g. America) but "whisky" when from countries that don't have an "e" in their names (e.g. Scotland, Japan)? Richard taught me that. Last but not least, Richard is the author of a brand-new book, “The Essential Scratch & Sniff Guide to Becoming a Whiskey Know-It-All,” which is sitting on my kitchen table with whiskey stains all over it. It distils (see what I did there?) a couple of lifetimes worth of study down to 24 pages...then makes them smell good. Definitely check it out. At the very least, it gives you a bunch of rules of thumb (like the whiskey vs. whisky trick), so you can impress your friends and not look like a dumb-ass at the bar. Sweet! Less dumb-ass and more smart-ass is always good. Get 'er done. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by MeUndies. If I’m not going commando, then I’m wearing MeUndies. I’ve been testing out pairs for about 3 or 4 months now, and, as a result, I've thrown out my other underwear. They look good, feel good, have options for men and women, and their materials are 2x softer than cotton, as evaluated using the Kawabata method. Not only does MeUndies offer underwear, but they also have incredible lounge pants. I wear them when I record the podcast, and when I’m out and about grabbing coffee. If by some chance you’re not happy with the first pair you try on, they’ll refund your purchase completely. Check out MeUndies.com/Tim to see my current faves (some are awesomely ridiculous) and, while you’re at it, don’t miss lots of hot ladies wearing MeUndies.  This podcast is also brought to you by Athletic Greens.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-218">
        I get asked a lot about investing. This is mostly due to start-up investing and the hoopla around it, but I've expanded my experiments to late-stage deals, real estate, and more. So far, my startup bets are 10x+ more successful (on paper) than my publishing career. Based on cashed-out positions, they're still several times more successful. I've had a lucky stretch. By no means am I an elite investor, but I've borrowed from elite investors since 2007. I'm incredibly fortunate that amazing people have been very generous with their time. Thank you, all! I've made hundreds of survivable mistakes, networked my little bald head off, and--net-net--I'm happy with the results. In this short podcast episode, I'll explain the 5 (or so) steps I took to become a better investor, starting at ground zero. Caveat emptor: I am NOT a financial advisor, and none of this advice should be taken without speaking to a qualified professional first. Also, my results could be due to pure luck and zero skill. M'kay? M'kay. Hope you enjoy, and please let me know in the comments if you'd like more of this. Or what you'd like more of.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-219">
        This episode features a dynamic duo. Seth Rogen (@SethRogen) is an actor, writer, producer, and director. Evan Goldberg (@EvanDGoldberg) is a Canadian director, screenwriter, and producer. Together, they get into a lot of mischief and create amazing comedy. They’ve collaborated on films such as Superbad (which they first conceived as teenagers), Knocked Up, Pineapple Express, The Green Hornet, and Funny People. They have also written for “Da Ali G Show” and “The Simpsons.” In 2013, Evan and Seth released their directorial debut, This Is the End.  In 2014, Seth starred in and produced (alongside Evan) Neighbors, which was a worldwide comedy hit and has taken in more than $268 million worldwide. In December 2014, Rogen and Goldberg’s film, The Interview, became the most-talked-about news story around the world. Under extremely difficult circumstances, the film persevered to become Sony Pictures' #1 digital title of all time. Neighbors 2 is shooting now and will be released next May. Seth and Evan are also in production on Sausage Party, a raunchy animated movie for adults about one sausage's quest to discover the truth about his existence. Seth and Evan are producing the film with Megan Ellison and Conrad Vernon. In our conversation, we discuss all manner of tactics and silliness, including:  Kyokushin karate Writer’s block and related debates Writing process Who are the most underrated comedians and comedy writers? How Superbad got made... after they first drafted it around age 13 The odd book Judd Apatow recommended to them (also Woody Allen's favorite) How The Kids in the Hall influenced them The movie they both wish they'd written Common pot mistakes Recommended newb pot for working versus relaxing Will there be a McLovin spinoff?

        Jocko Willink (@jockowillink) is one of the scariest human beings imaginable. He is a lean 230 pounds. He is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is a legend in the Special Operations world. His eyes look through you more than at you. He rarely does interviews, if ever. But a few weeks ago, Jocko ended up staying at my house and we had a caffeinated mind meld. Here's some background... Jocko enlisted in the Navy after high school and spent 20 years in the SEAL Teams, first as an enlisted SEAL operator and then as a SEAL officer. During his second tour in Iraq, he led SEAL Task Unit Bruiser in the Battle of Ramadi--some of the toughest and sustained combat in the SEAL Teams since Vietnam. Under his leadership, Task Unit Bruiser became the most highly decorated Special Operations Unit of the entire war in Iraq and helped bring stability to Ramadi. Jocko was awarded the Bronze Star and a Silver Star. Upon returning to the United States, Jocko served as the Officer-in-Charge of training for all West Coast SEAL Teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic combat training in the world. So why is Jocko opening up? Well, in part, we have mutual friends. Second, he is the co-author of an incredible new book — Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win -- which I've been loving. Trust me. Buy it. This is his first mainstream interview and one you won't want to miss. Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast.

        This episode of The Tim Ferriss Show is a bit of an experiment. Most the time, I interview many world-class people, and I ask them many, many questions to try and figure out what makes them good at what they do.  Many of you have wondered what would happen if I flipped the script and had to answer my own questions. In this episode, I decided to do just that and answer one of your most common questions: what does your morning routine look like?  What you’ll find here are the five things I do every morning. These are the five things I’d like to accomplish on an “ideal day.” If I can hit at least three of these items, then I’ve won the morning. And, as the saying goes, “If you win the morning, you win the day.”  Let me know if you like this type of episode by responding to me on Twitter (@tferriss) or Facebook. Please let me know if you want more, never want to hear these answers again, or suggest another question you’d like me to answer.  Enjoy!

        Martin Polanco (@Martin_Polanco7), M.D., is the founder and program director of Crossroads Treatment Center, based in Rosarito, Mexico. Crossroads specializes in helping patients conquer powerful addictions (heroin, cocaine, etc.) by using the African hallucinogen ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT, also referred to as “the God molecule.” Martin's areas of expertise also include addiction medicine and therapeutic neurotechnologies.  Dan Engle (@drdanengle), M.D., is a psychiatrist and neurologist, who combines functional medicine with integrative psychiatry to enhance regenerative health and peak performance. His prior and relevant experience includes traumatic brain injury (TBI) and working in the Peruvian jungle with plant medicines such as ayahuasca.  In this episode, we step outside the lines of traditional medicine to discuss impulse control, introspection, and self-awareness through the use of powerful psychedelic and hallucinogenic agents like iboga, ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT.  We also discuss flotation tanks, which can simulate or even replicate many of the benefits that can result from the use of psychedelic and psychotropic agents. So you don't have to be willing to experiment with these medicines to receive something valuable from this episode.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-224">
        100 episodes! Whaaat?!  This celebratory episode involves me drunk dialing a bunch of you on Skype. We'll get to that. But first, a little background and thank you...  My podcast--The Tim Ferriss Show--was started on a whim. It was intended as a break between big book projects. "I'll do six episodes to get better at interviewing" was the grand goal.  In the first episode (and after two bottles of wine), Kevin Rose nicknamed the show TimTimTalkTalk (damn you, KevKev). Later, after reviewing my ridiculously slurred and iffy questions ("If you were a breakfast cereal, which would you be?"), I let out a long sigh. I've always hated the sound of my own voice, but this was the worst. The Tim-as-host idea would not last.  Or so I thought.  Now, here we are, passing the 100-episode mark. It's crazy, and I can say one thing for certain -- I've only made it this far because of YOU.  Your amazing feedback, support, questions, and comments are what kept this podcast alive. Amidst self-doubt (similar to this) and many mistakes, I've wanted to throw in the towel more than once. But, through thick and thin, you've been there, telling my monkey mind to chill the fuck out, to take a deep breath, to go to sleep, to fight another day.  Thank you.  To celebrate, and as a throwback to episode #1, I posted a note on Twitter and Facebook asking fans to put their contact information in a short Google form (note: I've deactivated the link):  I'm going to be drunk dialing fans within 30 min, answering your questions! Just fill out this form and I might call: http://t.co/E4Xub881qB — Tim Ferriss (@tferriss) September 8, 2015   The result of my vodka-infused orgy of telephonic idiocy is below. We cover a lot of subjects, including:  - Tantric sex - How I view and organize my various income streams - Marketing yourself in job interviews - My views (and challenges) with family and kids - How I dig out of negative downward spirals - And much more...  I also left semi-coherent voicemails for a number of you.  Once again, thank you so much for listening to this podcast. It means the world to me.  You guys rock.  Enjoy!

It has exploded in popularity in the last 2 years, and now has more than $2.5B under management. In fact, some of my good investor friends in Silicon Valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams  Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they’ll show you—for free–exactly the portfolio they’d put you in.

        WARNING: AS I’VE EMPHASIZED BEFORE, NEVER DO BREATHING EXERCISES IN WATER OR BEFORE TRAINING IN WATER. SHALLOW-WATER BLACKOUTS CAN BE FATAL.  Wim Hof (@Iceman_hof) is a Dutch world record holder, adventurer and daredevil, commonly nicknamed “The Iceman" for his ability to withstand extreme cold. He is the creator of the Wim Hof Method and holds more than 20 world records. Wim is an outlier of outliers, as he routinely asks scientists to scrutinize and validate his feats. Here are just a few examples:  In 2007, he climbed past the “death zone" altitude on Mount Everest (~7,500 meters) wearing nothing but shorts. In 2009, Hof completed a full marathon above the polar circle in Finland, in temperatures close to −20 °C (−4 °F). Dressed in nothing but shorts, Hof finished in 5 hours and 25 minutes. Hof holds the current Guinness World Record for the longest ice bath, now set at 1 hour 53 minutes and 12 seconds.   But it’s not just cold.  In 2011, he ran a full marathon in the Namib Desert without water. The run was performed under the supervision of Dr. Thijs Eijsvogels. He can also run at altitude without suffering from altitude sickness. In the same year, he was injected with toxins under doctor supervision and demonstrated that he could effectively control his autonomic immune response. Wim was able to raise his cortisol levels and lower his blood concentrations of cytokines (inflammatory mediators) using solely his meditation and prep techniques.   Not only this, but he was able to train others to achieve the same effect… with only 4 days of training!    We dig into all this and more.  I loved this conversation and hope you do, too... All show notes, links, and resources from this episode can be found at http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast  This episode is brought to you by Audible, which I have used for years. I love audiobooks. I have two to recommend right off the bat:  The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman – Perhaps my favorite audiobook of all time. Vagabonding by Rolf Potts – This book had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what has become The 4-Hour Workweek   To get your free audiobook and a free 30-day trial, go to Audible.com/Tim. You can choose from the two audiobooks listed above or from 180,000+ audio programs. They offer audiobooks, magazines, newspapers and even classes. It’s that easy. Go to Audible.com/Tim and grab your free audiobook.  This podcast is also brought to you by MeUndies. Have you ever wanted to be as powerful as a mullet-wearing ninja from the 1980’s, or as sleek as a black panther in the Amazon? Of course you have, and that’s where MeUndies comes in. I’ve spent the last 2-3 weeks wearing underwear from these guys 24/7, and they are the most comfortable and colorful underwear I’ve ever owned. Their materials are 2x softer than cotton, as evaluated using the Kawabata method. Check out MeUndies.com/Tim to see my current faves (some are awesomely ridiculous) and, while you’re at it, don’t miss lots of hot ladies wearing MeUndies.

        Reid Hoffman (@reidhoffman) is often referred to as "The Oracle of Silicon Valley" by tech insiders, who look at his company-building and investing track record (Facebook, Airbnb, Flickr, etc.) with awe. Reid is Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of LinkedIn, which has more than 300 million users. He was previously Executive Vice President at PayPal, which was purchased by eBay for $1.5 billion. There, he was nicknamed "firefighter-in-chief" by CEO Peter Thiel.  Noted venture capitalist David Sze says of Reid, "[he] is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade." They are now both partners at Greylock Partners.  In this podcast, he is joined by Michael McCullough, MD, a close friend, co-founder of QuestBridge.org, and a successful investor with training as an ER physician. Michael is as an Assistant Clinical Professor at UCSF and previously served as the on-call ER physician to the Dalai Lama. Michael is also a Rhodes Scholar, Kaufman Fellow, and Ashoka Fellow. An avid meditator, he is particularly interested in investing in technologies and companies pertaining to the mind.  We cover A LOT, including:  Meeting Mark Zuckerberg for the first time and deciding to invest in Facebook "Fire-fighting" in startups and beyond Using board games to develop strategy Reid's view of what Uber has done well and what they could improve Some of Reid's suggested philosophers for entrepreneurs Non-technical founders and symbolic systems Going "off algorithm" in the ER to manage life-and-death decisions The 3 types of CEOs What Reid has learned from his network, including the founders of Airbnb, Kiva.org, etc.   And, of course, we discuss QuestBridge, as Reid and I are both on the advisory board.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-228">
        Welcome to a special edition of The Tim Ferriss Show. Back in 2007, I experienced a massive tipping point for The 4-Hour Workweek at the South by Southwest (SXSW)conference held in Austin, Texas. Two or three days played a key role in the book becoming a worldwide bestseller in 40+ languages.   So what exactly happened at the event? How did I optimize those 2-3 days?   The below audio is a presentation I recently gave about a better, more effective way to network. My suggestions might surprise you or seem counterintuitive–the best way to build a world-class network quickly is to spend very little time networking, at least not in the “ugh, gross” sleazy sense of the word.   In this episode, you’ll learn:    How SXSW played a role in the success of The 4-Hour Workweek   How you can “stack the deck” for your own product launches   Simple biohacks for handling booze overload and sleep deprivation   Why it’s so important to meet people in person  to build your network   The most common mistakes people make when attempting to “network”   How to interact with A-listers (or opt not to)   How to enjoy the ride and not end  up exhausted with a pocket full of business cards that do nothing   And much, much more…    If you are able to apply a few lessons from this talk, you may find that you never have to network again.   There is a better way.  For all links, show notes, resources from this episode, please visit http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast  This episode is brought to you advertisement free. Want this to happen more often?  Every Friday I send out a very short email called 5-Bullet Friday. These are the coolest things I've been playing with that week. It could include favorite articles, gizmos and gadgets, and a lot of other awesome stuff you could use immediately.   Sign up for a week, and give it a try.  It would mean a lot to me and I think you'll enjoy it.   Enjoy!

        Robert Rodriguez (@Rodriguez) is a film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, and musician. He is also the founder and chairman of El Rey Network, the new genre-busting English-language cable network.  While a student at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, Robert Rodriguez wrote the script to his first feature film while he was a paid subject in a clinical experiment at a drug research facility. That paycheck covered the cost of shooting his film. He planned to make the money back by selling the film to the Mexican home video market.  The film, “El Mariachi,” went on to win the coveted Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and became the lowest budget movie ever released by a major studio. Rodriguez wrote about these experiences in Rebel Without a Crew, a perennial guide for the independent filmmaker.  Rodriguez went on to write, produce, direct and edit a series of successful films including Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, the Spy Kids franchise, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Frank Miller’s Sin City, and Machete.

He is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine, which he co-founded in 1993. He also co-founded the All Species Foundation, a non-profit aimed at cataloging and identifying every living species on earth.

        Tara Brach (@TaraBrach) is a PhD in clinical psychology and one of the leading teachers of Buddhist thinking and meditation in the Western world.  She is the founder of the Insight Meditation Community in Washington, D.C. and her lectures are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each month.  I was first introduced to Tara's work by another guest on this podcast, Maria Popova. Soon thereafter, a friend and neuroscience PhD recommended her book, Radical Acceptance, as life-changing. It exceeded all expectations.  It’s my hope that this tactical conversation offers you techniques for addressing loneliness, anger, self-hatred, the “trance of unworthiness,” and much more. Tara’s had a measurable impact on my life, and I wish the same for you.  For those who know my fondness for Stoic philosophy, I think Tara’s work is a fantastic compliment to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and the other favorites.

Her work has been featured in The Economist, Wired, and The New York Times. She has been called one of the "top ten innovators to watch" by BusinessWeek and one of the "100 most creative people in business” by Fast Company. Her TED talks on games have been viewed more than ten million times.  In this conversation, we dig into everything from recovering from head trauma to how you can use Candy Crush Saga to lose weight. Not enough? How about using Tetris to prevent PTSD, or using Call of Duty to increase empathy?  Her latest book is SuperBetter, which offers a revolutionary (science-based) approach for getting stronger, happier, and more resilient. I’ve been testing it, and it works.  Not only am I feeling better, but I’m having more fun.  As adults, we often lose track of play. My hope is that this episode will help you to reclaim it.  It’s not frivolous; it can help you get a lot more done with less stress.  In this episode we discuss:  Examples of real world problems that are solved with games or by gamers  How Jane climbed herself out of the hole of suicidal thoughts  Action steps for using gaming lessons and applying them to real life  How to build a quest into your life  The health effects of Candy Crush Saga  On the use of psychedelics to simulate traumatic experiences  And much more...

        "Push yourself harder than you think you're capable of. You'll find new depth inside yourself." - Stanley McChrystal     Stanley McChrystal (@StanMcChrystal) retired from the U.S. Army as a four-star general after more than 34 years of service. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates described McChrystal as “perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I ever met.”  From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal served as Commander of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.  The follow-up questions are really fun. In this particular episode, he answers questions such as:  If he could put a billboard anywhere and write anything on it, where would it be and what would it say? What are three tests/practices from the military that civilians could use to help develop mental toughness? What are his favorite documentaries or movies? Why? What $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted his life in the last twelve months and why?

        Stanley McChrystal (@StanMcChrystal)  retired from the U.S. Army as a four-star general after more than 34 years of service. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates described McChrystal as "perhaps the finest warrior and leader of men in combat I ever met."  From 2003 to 2008, McChrystal served as Commander of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.  His last assignment was as the commander of all American and coalition forces in Afghanistan. He is currently a senior fellow at Yale University’s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and the co-founder of CrossLead, a leadership consulting firm.  In this episode, we discuss everything imaginable, including:  - Why he eats only one meal per day - His exact exercise routines - Tactical and psychological lessons of combat - Self-talk used before and after difficult missions - The value and development of mental toughness - Favorite books, documentaries, etc. - And much, much more  Chris Fussell (@FussellChris), who also joins the conversation, is a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, former Aide-de-Camp for General McChrystal, and a current senior executive at CrossLead.

        "My lab is interested in pursuing how we can enhance cognition to improve quality of life." - Adam Gazzaley  Dr. Adam Gazzaley (@adamgazz) obtained an M.D. and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, then postdoctoral training in cognitive neuroscience at UC Berkeley. He is now the director of the Gazzaley Lab at UC San Francisco, a cognitive neuroscience laboratory.  His recent studies go far beyond mere description — he and his lab are exploring neuroplasticity and how we can optimize cognitive abilities, even in healthy adults. So, what happens when you combine cognitive-focused video games with neurofeedback, magnetic and electrical stimulation, and even performance-enhancing drugs? Well, that’s just one of many things we cover in this conversation.  As someone with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease on both sides of my family, I find Adam's work to be of incredible importance and promise.  I hope this discussion blows your mind, in the best way possible.

        This episode is intended to help you with unexpected problems that will crop up this week. My guest is Ryan Holiday, who became Director of Marketing at American Apparel at age 21 (!). He’s a beast. Since dropping out of college at 19 to apprentice under strategist Robert Greene (author of The 48 Laws of Power), Ryan has advised many New York Times bestselling authors and mega-multi-platinum musicians. He knows how to build massive buzz while responding to unexpected crises. He can compete or counterpunch with the best. For this reason, I asked him to share one of his popular stories on Thomas Edison, as well as Jack Johnson and others.  If you want to thrive in high-stress environments, this is well worth the time.

        Rick Rubin has been called "the most important [music] producer of the last 20 years" by MTV.   Rick is also revered as something of a Zen master across industries, and he is as deep as he is soft-spoken. He rarely grants interviews, and one condition of doing this one was the setting: his hyper-heated barrel sauna at home. [Show notes can be found at fourhourworkweek.com/podcast]  In this episode, we delve into how Rick helps artists (e.g. Jay Z, Shakira, Johnny Cash, etc.) produce their best work. Not only that, we also discuss Rick's step-by-step experience losing 135+ pounds. He describes underwater weightlifting stories, training with Laird Hamilton, testing different diets, and much more.  Rick's resume includes everyone from Johnny Cash to Jay Z. His metal artists include groups like Black Sabbath, Slayer, System of a Down, Metallica, Rage Against the Machine, and Linkin Park. He's worked with pop artists like Shakira, Adele, Sheryl Crow, Lana Del Rey, and Lady Gaga. He's also been credited with helping to popularize hip hop with artists like LL Cool J, The Beastie Boys, Eminem, Jay Z, and Kanye West.  And that's just a small sample.  This conversation teaches a cohesive lesson in breaking down complex skills with deep and subtle problem solving.  The sauna caused the microphones to burn our hands and us to nearly pass out. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, folks! I think it adds a hilarious element to the whole thing, but it's not without risks.  Enjoy!

To keep things extra spicy, he's become a taco connoisseur and created 4 separate products that have generated more than 7 figures.  This podcast conversation is about all of the tools and tricks he uses to do it all.    Noah was my co-teacher in the "Starting a Business" episode of The Tim Ferriss Experiment, which is now the #1 TV season across all of iTunes.

But back to the current podcast...  Noah and I cover a ton, including his favorite tools, apps, books, routines, and more.  It ranges from apps for preventing distractions, to how he blocks out time every Tuesday for learning, to how he gained 40 pounds of (mostly) muscle in the last six months or so.

        Samy Kamkar is one of the most innovative and notorious computer hackers in the United States.  He’s also a well-known whistleblower.  If you want how Samy hacks everything from online dating to car alarms, this episode is for you.   He is best known for creating the fastest spreading virus of all time, a MySpace worm named “Samy.” He got raided by the United States Secret Service for that one. More recently, he’s created SkyJack, a custom drone that hacks into any nearby drones, allowing him (or any operator) to control a swarm of devices; and Evercookie, which appeared in top-secret NSA documents revealed by Edward Snowden. He also discovered illicit mobile phone tracking by Apple iPhone, Google Android and Microsoft Windows Phone mobile devices, which were transmitting GPS and Wi-Fi information to their parent companies.   His research and findings led to a series of class-action lawsuits against these companies and a privacy hearing on Capitol Hill.   To see Samy help me hack my online dating, check out the “Dating Game” TV episode here: http://itunes.com/timferriss   Here is Samy’s site (http://samy.pl/), his outstanding YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4m2G6T18_JcjwxwtwKJijw), and his Twitter (https://twitter.com/samykamkar).   This episode is brought to you by two companies I use myself: 99Designs — http://99designs.com/tim Mizzen & Main — http://mizzenandmain.com/collections/tim   Enjoy!

        Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer.  This episode is DEEP, in the best way possible.  Considered a chess prodigy, he has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian jiu-jitsu (he’s a black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia) and Tai Chi Push Hands (he’s a world champion). These days, he spends his time coaching the world’s top performers, whether Mark Messier, Cal Ripken Jr., or hedgefund managers.  I initially met Josh through his incredible book, The Art of Learning.

        "Why would I be wound up? I'm either ready, or I'm not. Worrying about it right now ain't gonna change a damn thing."  - Floyd Mayweather, Jr. just before a fight, as recalled by Paul Levesque [34:20]  Paul Levesque, more popularly known as Triple H, is a 13-time World Heavyweight Champion in World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE). He is also the Executive Vice President of talent, live-events, and creative at the WWE.  In this episode, we explore everything: the teachings of Killer Kowalski, how he avoids and repairs injuries (even if on the road 200+ days of the year), pre-game rituals, and habits developed with the support of trainer Joe DeFranco, The Undertaker, and boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr..

        The goal of this blog and my podcast is to push you outside of your comfort zone and force you to question assumptions.  This why I invite divergent thinkers and world-class performers who often disagree.  I might interview Tony Robbins (Part 1,  Part 2) and then  Matt Mullenweg, as I did. Or I might have  Sam Harris, PhD on and later invite a seemingly opposite guest like...   Glenn Beck.   This interview is a wild ride, and it happened — oddly enough -- thanks to a late-night sauna session.  I was catching up with an old friend, who is mixed-race, a Brown University grad, and liberal in almost every sense of the word.  I casually asked him, “If you could pick one person to be on the podcast, who would it be?"   “Glenn Beck,” he answered without a moment’s hesitation. “His story is FASCINATING."   He went on to describe how Glenn hit rock bottom and restarted his life in his 30’s. Fast forward to 2014, Forbes named him to their annual Celebrity 100 Power List and pegged his earnings at $90 million for that year.  This placed him ahead of people like Mark Burnett, Jimmy Fallon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith. Glenn's site, TheBlaze.com, gets somewhere between 30 and 50 million unique visitors per month.   This interview is neither a “gotcha” interview nor a softball interview.  I ask some very tough questions (some from listeners), but my primary goal was to pull out routines, habits, books, etc. that you can use.  There is no political agenda whatsoever.   If anything, this is a story of entrepreneurship, and whether you love Glenn, hate Glenn, or have never heard his name, there is a lot to learn from him.   Full show notes and links from this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast

        This 15-minute episode is experimental, and it might just change your life.  I suspect many of you will listen to it on an ongoing weekly basis, and that's precisely what I plan to do.   It's a wonderful essay from the newest book in the Tim Ferriss Book Club:  We Learn Nothing by Tim Kreider.  The essay stands on its own and is titled "Lazy: A Manifesto."  I loved this book so much that I reached out to Tim and we produced the audiobook together. If you want to stop feeling rushed, this is the medicine you need. Here is what writer/director Judd Apatow has to say about Tim Kreider:  "Tim Kreider's writing is heartbreaking, brutal and hilarious—usually at the same time. He can do in a few pages what I need several hours of screen time and tens of millions to accomplish. And he does it better. Come to think of it, I'd rather not do a blurb. I am beginning to feel bad about myself." - Judd Apatow And one more: "Tim Kreider may be the most subversive soul in America and his subversions—by turns public and intimate, political and cultural—are just what our weary, mixed-up nation needs. The essays in We Learn Nothing are for anybody who believes it's high time for some answers, damn it." - Richard Russo, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Empire Falls Enjoy! Don't miss this one.

She is widely known as “The Social Media Queen of Rock-N-Roll” for her intimate engagement with fans via her blog, Tumblr, and Twitter (1,000,000+ followers), and she has been at the vanguard of using both “direct-to-fan” and “pay what you want” (patronage) business models to build and run her business.
Amanda's new book, The Art of Asking, is a New York Times' best seller and a damn fine read.

        DISCLAIMER: DO NOT CONSUME ANY DRUGS WITHOUT CONSULTING A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.JAMES FADIMAN, Ph.D., did his undergraduate work at Harvard and his graduate work at Stanford, doing research with the Harvard Group, the West Coast Research Group in Menlo Park, and Ken Kesey. He is the author of The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide.Called “America’s wisest and most respected authority on psychedelics and their use,” Jim Fadiman has been involved with psychedelic research since the 1960s. In this episode, we discuss the immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics when used for spiritual purposes (high dose), therapeutic purposes (moderate dose), and problem-solving purposes (low dose). Fadiman outlines best practices for safe "entheogenic" voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.We also discuss new uses for LSD and other psychedelics, including extremely low doses for improved cognitive function. Cautioning that psychedelics are not for everyone, he dispels the myths and misperceptions about psychedelics, which are commonly circulated in textbooks. Fadiman explain how -- in his opinion -- psychedelics, used properly, can lead not only to healing but also to scientific breakthroughs and spiritual epiphanies.Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast

-What are the 3 most dangerous exercises in CrossFit gyms?- What are the most common nutritional mistakes of CrossFit athletes?- What do elite CrossFit athletes do differently than the rest? Example: How do Rich Froning and Jason Khalipa warm up?- Is the CrossFit Games really CrossFit?- Is CrossFit a fad?- What is the future of CrossFit?
The man to answer all this (and much more) is Kelly Starrett.  He's trained CrossFit athletes for more than 130,000 hours (!) and 10 years at San Francisco CrossFit, which opened in 2005 as one of the first 50 CrossFit Affiliates in the world. There are now more than 10,000 Affiliates worldwide.
Kelly's clients include Olympic gold medalists, Tour de France cyclists, world record holders in Olympic lifting and powerlifting, Crossfit Games medalists, professional ballet dancers, and elite military personnel.
Even if you have zero interest in CrossFit, this conversation invites you inside the mind of one of the world's top coaches.  Kelly discusses habits, strategies, and thinking that can be applied to nearly everything. We cover a lot.
QUESTION(S) OF THE DAY: If you had to pick one sport or weightlifting movement for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? Please share and explore answers in the comments here.

Bio -- Mark Hart:
Mark Hart is the founder of Corriente Partners, an investment fund focused on placing long/short equity trades based on macroeconomic themes. Mark launched his first hedge fund as a junior partner in November of 1998, and in 2001 launched Corriente Partners, where his macroeconomic framework led him to first question the security of the mortgage and housing market. Managing his portfolio accordingly, Mark earned a sizable return on his positions during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis - one of the single best performances of that downturn.

        Justin Boreta is a founding member of The Glitch Mob. Their music has been featured in movies like Sin City II, Edge of Tomorrow, Captain America, and Spiderman.
In this episode, we discuss The Glitch Mob's path from unknown band to playing sold-out 90,000-person (!) arenas.  We delve into war stories, and Justin plays us never-before-heard "drafts" of blockbuster tracks to show creative process.  Even if you have zero interest in music, Justin discusses habits and strategies that can be applied to nearly anything.  Meditation?  Morning routines?  We cover it all.
The Glitch Mob's last album, Love Death Immortality, debuted on the Billboard charts at #1 Electronic Album, #1 Indie Label, and #4 Overall Digital Album. This is particularly impressive because The Glitch Mob is an artist-owned group.  It's a true start-up.

        Dr. Peter Diamandis has been named one of “The World’s 50 Greatest Leaders" by Fortune Magazine.
You asked for an entire episode with him, so here it is!  The subject is simple: How to think big, and how to use the key strategies of Peter's friends and investors, including Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, and Larry Page. How do they create maximum leverage? How do they think differently? We explore all of this.SHOW NOTES and other links should be available shortly here.
In the field of innovation, Diamandis is Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE Foundation. Among many other things, Diamandis is also the Co-Founder (along with Craig Venter and Bob Hariri) of Human Longevity Inc. (HLI); and Co-Founder of Planetary Resources, a company designing spacecraft to mine asteroids for precious materials (seriously).
If I could ask one person to write one book, it would Peter and his new tome, Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth, and Impact the World.  In fact, I have been asking him for years, and now it has arrived.  The back cover also gave me serious blurb envy. Check out these testimonials from Bill Clinton, Eric Schmidt, and Ray Kurzweil. Ray says simply: “If you read one business book in the twenty-first century, this should be the one."

        This episode was a real treat.  It was one of the most enlightening and lucid conversations about physical training I've ever had.  Show notes and links from this episode can be found here.
Pavel Tsatsouline is Chairman of StrongFirst, Inc. and was born in Minsk, USSR, which is now part of Belarus. 
In the 1980s, he was a physical-training instructor for Spetnaz, the elite Soviet special-forces units. Pavel is now a subject matter expert to the US Marine Corps, the US Secret Service, and the US Navy SEALs, and he is widely credited with introduced the now ubiquitous kettlebell to the United States. 
Over the last several years, Pavel has become a friend, and his input was critical to the success (and experiments) of The 4-Hour Body.

Ed Cooke is a dear friend and a Grandmaster of Memory.  In 2010, he was interviewed by a journalist named Joshua Foer. Under Ed's Yoda-like training, Joshua became the very next American Memory Champion in 2011.  It took less than a year for Ed to transform a novice from unknown to world-class.

In this episode, we'll go deep into the digital underground to expose the alarming ways criminals, corporations, and even countries are using emerging technologies against you…and some simple steps you can take to decrease your vulnerability.
To start, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bio-terrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders (all of which we touch on), but what else is waiting for you? What else is potentially targeting you right now?
If you want to hear about current and future threats, and simple defensive steps you can take, this interview is for you.

        This is a special edition of The Tim Ferriss Show -- an audio version of The Random Show with my friend Kevin Rose (serial founder, Google Ventures).
The last few episodes have been rather serious, so this is intended as an informal (but still informative) mind snack. There are dozens of topics covered in this bromantic episode of scatterbrained nonsense.
Like what? To start off: hidden gems in Japan, hating tech, Kevin’s new obsessions (and projects), gifts, books we're reading, excessive sexual awkwardness, and much more. O-tanoshimi dane!

Nick is the founder and CTO of ZocDoc. As CTO, he is responsible for overseeing all software development. It's a huge job for one of the fastest-growing startups in the US, and he's repeatedly proven himself to be a master teacher.All show notes, links, resources for this episode can be found on www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. Enjoy!

        Margaret Cho is a polymath.
She is an internationally acclaimed comic, actress, author, fashion designer and singer-songwriter. Perhaps you've seen her on the big screen, or in TV series such as Sex and the City and 30 Rock.
But well before she was on Dancing with the Stars (yes, she's done that, too), she decided on her comedy career... at the tender age of eight.  The stage has been her constant companion ever since.In this episode we delve into her comic influences and approaches, bisexuality, slow-carb adventures, and much more. Please indulge me as we dig deep into the lesser-known tricks of the Slow-Carb Diet. Margaret had a lot of detailed questions (she's followed it for ~3 months), and the answers might help accelerate your own fat loss.  (If you want more, here are several case studies -- with pics -- who've lost 100+ pounds.)

Rolf Potts is the author of Vagabonding (hear the audio book sample here), one of my favorite books of all-time.  It was one of just two books (the other was Walden) that I carried with me around the world from 2004-2005.  Those adventures led directly to The 4-Hour Workweek.
In this often hilarious conversation, Rolf and I dig deep into travel tactics, creating time wealth, "managing success," and much more.  It's a fun romp through every imaginable topic, from business to poetry, and from Wall Street to psychedelics.

        Andrew Zimmern is a world-class chef, television host and producer, writer, and -- at the end of the day -- teacher. You've probably seen his shows Bizarre Foods and Dining with Death. In 2010 and 2013 he was awarded the James Beard Foundation Award, which annually presents awards for excellence in cuisine, culinary writing, and culinary television.
But many people don't know the earlier chapters in his life.  At one point, he was sleeping on the streets, stealing purses, and shooting heroin. In our interview, he shares all.  We delve into everything, including his culinary tricks, how he developed his hit TV show, his influences, key turning points in his life, beating addiction, and much more.
This is a powerful interview.
It's full of tactics for anyone, and it has extra insights for all types of compulsive behavior (and, really, who doesn't have at least one?).  I hope you enjoy it.

        This episode is sponsored by 99Designs and ExOfficio.Maria Popova has written for amazing outlets like The Atlantic and The New York Times, but I find her most amazing project to be BrainPickings.org.Founded in 2006 as a weekly email that went out to seven friends, BrainPickings now get more than 5 million readers per month (!). I read very few blogs regularly, but BrainPickings is one of the few.  It is a treasure trove.BrainPickings is Maria's one-woman labor of love — her subjective lens on what matters in the world and why. It's also an inquiry into how to live and what it means to lead a good life.  From Mark Twain to Oscar Wilde and everyone in between, Maria finds hidden gems to share.And that's what I hoped to do in this episode.  It takes me a few minutes to warm up in this interview, but as soon as we get going, we geek out like crazy, talking about almost every aspect of her life, her site, her business, and her writing.
I loved doing this interview, and I hope you love listening to it.  There are a lot of valuable nuggets.

Tony Robbins is the world's most famous performance coach. He's advised everyone from Bill Clinton to Serena Williams, and from Leonardo DiCaprio to Oprah (who calls him "superhuman").
For years, you've also asked me to interview him in-depth -- so here it is! I flew to Florida to spend time with Tony in his home, and what ensued was an epic two-part conversation.  It covers just about everything I've ever wanted to ask him, ranging from his breakfast and morning routines, all the way to who he'd most like to punch in the face (it's a hilarious story).My visit also coincided with his first new book in 20 years: Money--Master the Game.

        Mike Shinoda is best known as the rapper, principal songwriter, keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and one of the two vocalists of Linkin Park, which has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide and earned two Grammy Awards in the process.Mike has collaborated with everyone from Jay-Z to Depeche Mode, and he's also the lead rapper in his side project Fort Minor, which I'm a huge fan of.
As if that's not enough, he's also provided artwork, production and mixing for all the projects that I just mentioned. The man is a beast... but did he start out that way? The answers might surprise you.
This episode covers how he got started, advice for beginning musicians (or creatives/artists of any type), navigating "entertainment" and Hollywood, daily rituals, how he writes songs, how he and his band rehearse, and much more.Enjoy!

        Dan Carlin is the host of my favorite podcast, Hardcore History.But... what?! History?! I know. I thought the same thing. How could a history podcast have a cult following?And yet it did. During research for launching The Tim Ferriss Show, I asked many of the top dogs on the iTunes charts: what is your favorite podcast? Almost without exception, the answer came back: Hardcore History.Since then, I've become friends with Dan (and more obsessed with his show), and this episode explores all the questions I've been dying to ask him, whether related to his early experiments, his "radio" voice, creativity, building podcasts, and much more.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed doing it.

        I consider Kevin Rose one of the best "stock pickers" in the early startup game, and he can predict even non-tech trends with stunning accuracy. Kevin is a tech entrepreneur who co-founded Digg, Revision3 (sold to Discovery Channel), Pownce, and Milk (sold to Google). Since 2012, he is a venture partner at Google Ventures.  He's also a hilarious dude, and this episode involves heavy drinking.
