            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-1"><p>Maria Sharapova (<a href="https://twitter.com/MariaSharapova" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MariaSharapova</a>) is one of the best tennis players in the world. She is the winner of five Grand Slam titles (two at the French Open and one each at the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) and an Olympic silver medalist.</p> <p>Forbes named Maria the highest-paid female athlete of all-time in 2005 -- a title she's held for 12 years. Off the court, she's an ambassador for many of the world's top luxury brands and a number of Fortune 500 companies including Porsche, Nike, Evian, and Head. In 2007, she became a goodwill ambassador for the <a href= "http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Development Program</a> (UNDP) and has made significant contributions to Chernobyl-related projects. Her first book, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374279799/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unstoppable: My Life So Far</a>, comes out this year.</p> <p>In this conversation, we went deep into tactics of training, mental performance, mental toughness, and much more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "https://tim.blog/podcast">tim.blog/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://kettleandfire.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Kettle & Fire</a>, the first shelf-stable (never frozen) bone broth that uses 100 percent grass-fed, organically grazed animals. Recommended by past guests like Dom D'Agostino and Amelia Boone, Kettle & Fire is slow-simmered for 20+ hours so the bone broth is packed with collagen -- 19 times more than its closest competitor -- and other key proteins and amino acids.</p> <p>Need that slow carb diet boost? <a href= "https://kettleandfire.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take a look at kettleandfire.com/tim for 20 percent off your entire order</a>!</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "https://www.ascentprotein.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Ascent Protein</a>, the best protein I've ever tried. Ascent is the only US-based company that offers native proteins -- both whey and micellar casein -- directly to the consumer for improved muscle health and performance. Because the product is sourced from Ascent's parent company, Leprino Foods -- the largest producer of mozzarella cheese in the world -- it's entirely free of artificial ingredients and completely bypasses the bleaching process common to most other whey products on the market.</p> <p>If you want cleaner, more pure, less processed protein -- which I certainly do -- <a href= "https://www.ascentprotein.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">go to ascentprotein.com/tim for 20 percent off your entire order</a>!</p></div>

Hellmuth is also known for his temperamental "poker brat" personality -- reflected in his new book, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1909457744/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poker Brat: Phil Hellmuth's Autobiography</a>.</p> <p>This episode comes from my new television show <a href= "https://tim.blog/fearless" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Fear(less)</a>, where I interview world-class performers about how they've overcome doubt, conquered fear, and made their toughest decisions.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-3"><p>Cal Fussman (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/calfussman" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@calfussman</a>) is a <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author and a writer-at-large for <em>Esquire </em>magazine, where he is best known for being a primary writer of the "<a href= "http://www.esquire.com/what-ive-learned-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What I've Learned</a>" feature. He has transformed oral history into an art form, conducting probing interviews with a long list of icons who've shaped the last 50 years of world history.</p> <p>I've been trying to get Cal to do his own podcast. Rather than overthinking it, I simply asked Cal to interview a friend who I would also love to have on the podcast: Larry King. This episode is the result of that request.</p> <p>Larry King (<a href="https://twitter.com/kingsthings" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">@kingsthings</a>) has been dubbed "The most remarkable talk show host on TV, ever" by TV Guide and "Master of the mic" by Time Magazine. Larry's been described as the Muhammad Ali of the broadcast interview, and he's been inducted into five of the nation's leading broadcasting halls of fame. He's the recipient of the Allen H. Neuharth Award for Excellence in Journalism, an Emmy, the George Foster Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting, ten CableACE awards -- the list goes on.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "https://tim.blog/podcast">tim.blog/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.shopify.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Shopify</a>. With the help of Shopify, many readers of my blog -- first-time business owners -- have ended up making millions of dollars each with their side gigs. Back in 2009, I helped create Shopify's <a href= "https://www.shopify.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build a Business</a>, which is now the world's largest entrepreneurship competition.</p> <p>The goal of this competition is to entice would-be entrepreneurs to get off the couch and make things happen, and <a href= "https://www.shopify.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all you have to do to qualify is open a store on Shopify and start selling</a>. Top sellers in each category then have the exclusive opportunity to learn from mentors and experts like Tony Robbins, Daymond John, Seth Godin, Sir Richard Branson, and me a location like Oheka (aka Gatsby's) Castle or Necker Island.</p> <p>Listeners to this show can go to <a href= "https://www.shopify.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">shopify.com/tim</a> to sign up for a free, 30-day trial and get access to video courses that will help you get started -- including How to Quickly Start a Profitable Dropshipping Store with Corey Ferreira and some goodies from me. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Check it out at shopify.com/tim today</a>!</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "https://kettleandfire.co/pages/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Kettle & Fire</a>, which makes some of the best bone broth I've ever tasted. It came highly recommended by past podcast guests such as Amelia Boone and Dr. Dom D’Agostino. </p> <p><a href="https://kettleandfire.co/pages/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kettle & Fire</a> is the first shelf-stable (i.e. never frozen) bone broth that uses bones from 100% grass-fed, organically raised animals. They use longer cook times (20+ hours), which means more collagen and other nutrients. Visit <a href= "https://kettleandfire.co/pages/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Kettleandfire.com/tim</a> and you can receive 20% off your entire order. </p> <p> </p></div>

It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.</p> <p>People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement, and right now this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to <a class="external" title= "Link will open in a new window - Link will open in a new window - Link will open in a new window - Link will open in a new window - Link will open in a new window" href="http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer">foursigmatic.com/tim </a>and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-7"><p>In this episode, we discuss another common request from listeners. I've gathered some of the best advice about coping with frustrations and roadblocks, and -- ultimately -- learning how to turn failure into success.</p> <p>These conversations are extremely valuable because they show you there is more than one way to achieve your goals. After more than 200 conversations with the world's top performers, you start to spot certain patterns. These are the shared habits, hacks, philosophies, and tools that are the common threads of success, happiness, health, and wealth. Behind each success story is usually a lesson on how to overcome failure. Aside from my own take on the topic, this episode includes conversations with:</p> <ul> <li>Arnold Schwarzenegger</li> <li>Malcolm Gladwell</li> <li>Bryan Johnson</li> <li>A.J. Jacobs</li> <li>Shep Gordon</li> </ul> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p> </p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "https://tim.blog/podcast">tim.blog/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.soothe.com/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer">Soothe.com</a>, the world's largest on-demand massage service. Because I've been broken so many times, I have body work done at least twice a week -- so I have a high bar for this stuff. I do not accept mediocrity, and I wouldn't expect you to, either.</p> <p>After much personal testing, I can affirm that Soothe delivers a hand-selected, licensed, and experienced massage therapist to you in the comfort of your own home, hotel, or office in as little as an hour. I was amazed at the quality of service and convenience. Think of it as Uber for massages, available in fifty cities worldwide. <a href="https://www.soothe.com/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the app at Soothe.com</a> and use code TIM to get $20 off each of your first two massages.</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "http://meundies.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">MeUndies</a>. I've spent the last year wearing underwear from <a href="http://meundies.com/tim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these guys</a> 24/7, and they are the most comfortable and colorful underwear I've ever owned. MeUndies are designed in L.A. and made from sustainably sourced MicroModal -- a fabric three times softer than cotton. Even better, it includes free shipping.</p> <p>If you don't love your first pair of MeUndies, they'll hook you up with a new pair or a refund. If you love the product, they have three different subscription plans -- so you'll never be bored with the ever-changing selection. Check out <a href= "http://meundies.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">MeUndies.com/Tim</a> to see my current faves (some are awesomely ridiculous, like the camo) and get 20 percent off your first pair.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-8"><p>I'm very excited to share this episode. It's our first "roundtable" approach to discussing a single topic. This came about when I asked 5-Bullet Friday subscribers (<a href= "https://tim.blog/friday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up here if you're interested</a>) to send me questions, and one that stuck out was: Where's the line between stubbornly pursuing an idea that isn't working and the patience and persistence needed to actually make it work? In other words -- when should you give up and quit and when should you push on?</p> <p>Since this is something I myself have struggled with, I came to the conclusion that I should reach out to people who might have a better answer. So, I sent the question to the following entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators:</p> <ul> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2013/09/23/youd-like-to-be-an-angel-investor-heres-how-you-can-invest-in-my-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Belsky</a></li> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2016/08/03/seth-godin-on-how-to-think-small-to-go-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Godin</a></li> <li><a href="https://tim.blog/2014/07/11/james-altucher/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">James Altucher</a></li> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2017/03/25/the-secrets-tactics-and-creative-processes-of-high-performers-and-achievers-debbie-millman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debbie Millman</a></li> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2016/12/20/becoming-the-best-version-of-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Robinson</a></li> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2014/05/26/the-tim-ferriss-show-episode-8-chase-jarvis-master-photographer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chase Jarvis</a></li> <li><a href= "https://tim.blog/2017/05/04/smart-drugs-fasting-and-fat-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhonda Patrick</a></li> </ul> <p>Their answers are a thorough overview of how to assess your own ideas and opportunities, and determine which ones worth pursuing.

It is <a href= "http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer">mushroom coffee featuring chaga</a>. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.</p> <p>People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now -- this is the answer.

Arnold Schwarzenegger described him as "the real deal," "a champion human," and "one of the most inspiring people" he's ever met. Even the great Wayne Gretzky has spoken of Kyle's "greatness."</p> <p>Despite being born with a rare condition that left him with arms that end at the elbows and legs that end near his knees, he learned early on with the support of his family to live life independently and without prosthetics. Kyle thrives on physical challenges and, following a few rough middle school football seasons, he went on to become a champion wrestler, CrossFit Certified Instructor and gym owner, competitive MMA/Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter, world record-setting weightlifter, and skilled mountaineer.</p> <p>This episode comes from my new television show <a href= "http://tim.blog/fearless" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Fear{less}</a>, where I interview world-class performers on stage about how they've overcome doubt, conquered fear, and made their toughest decisions.

He's acted in more than thirty major motion pictures that have gone on to gross more than 1.7 billion at the box office. He is largely credited for redefining the R-rated comedy with his performance in the 2005 hit <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wedding Crashers</a>, which set the record for highest grossing R-rated comedy at the time. He is -- and will continue to be, I expect -- one of the most sought-after leading men in Hollywood.</p> <p>As a listener to this podcast, Vince reached out with his production company <a href="http://www.wwpsp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wild West</a> to see if we might do a TV show together. The result is <a href="http://tim.blog/fearless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fear{less} with Tim Ferriss</a> -- "less" is in parentheses because the objective is to teach you to fear less, not to be fearless. More details about the show can be found at <a href="http://tim.blog/fearless/" target= "_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tim.blog/fearless</a>.</p> <p>I got the chance to catch up with Vince at <a href= "http://vulturefestival.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener noreferrer">Vulture Festival</a> in New York City. In this conversation, we get into stories of his early beginnings, how to negotiate, his cold-calling career, and important decisions he's made as a producer, an artist, and a businessperson.

Going far beyond a typical tidying how-to, her method is a way of life and a state of mind.</p> <p>Marie captured the findings in her mega-best-selling books, including <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1607747308/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing</a> and its follow-up, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1607749726/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up</a>. Her books have sold more than seven million copies and have been published in more than forty countries.</p> <p>Kondo's methods have become so famous that her last name has become a verb, 'Kondo-ing,' and people who share her specific values are referred to as 'Konverts.' She has been named one of <a href= "http://time.com/collection-post/3822899/marie-kondo-2015-time-100/" target="_blank">Time Magazine's 100 most influential people</a>.</p> <p>Marie is also the Founder and Chief Visionary Officer of <a href="https://konmari.com/" target="_blank">KonMari Media Inc.</a> ("KMI"), a US-based startup with a mission to "Organize the World" by combining the power of technology and a network of Konverts and partner organizations. KMI also recently launched a <a href="https://konmari.com/consultants/" target="_blank">KonMari Consultant Training Program</a> and certification process.</p> <p>We dig into Shintoism, Marie's upbringing, specific details of her method, and much more.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a class="external" title="Link will open in a new window" href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">99Designs</a>, the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-33"><p>Ricardo Semler (<a href="https://twitter.com/ricardosemler" target="_blank">@ricardosemler</a>) is the former CEO of <a href= "http://www.semco.com.br/en/" target="_blank">Semco Partners</a>, a Brazilian company best known perhaps for its radical form of industrial democracy and corporate re-engineering.</p> <p>During his leadership, Semco grew from four million in 1982 to two hundred and twelve million in 2003. His innovative -- but very controversial -- business management policies have attracted widespread interest from all over the world.</p> <p>He is the best-selling author of <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446670553/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Maverick: The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace</a> and <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099425238/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Seven-Day Weekend: A Better Way to Work in the 21st Century</a> (not to be confused with <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307465357/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">another book</a> titled in an admittedly similar fashion).</p> <p>Ricardo recently started a podcast called <a href= "http://podcast.leadwise.co/" target="_blank">LeadWise</a>, where he has conversations with leaders about "challenging assumptions and changing how we live and work."</p> <p>Entrepreneurship and education are just two of the topics discussed in this wide-ranging conversation. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Ricardo Semler as much as I did!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.freshbooks.com/pages/tim?ref=11864&utm_source=tim-ferriss&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=2016&utm_content=email" target="_blank">FreshBooks</a>.

Her latest is the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Gutsy-Girl-Escapades-Adventure/dp/1632861232/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Gutsy Girl: Escapades for Your Life of Epic Adventure</a></em>.</p> <p>Once a young scaredy-cat, Caroline decided that fear got in the way of excitement, confidence, and self-reliance.

I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is <a href="http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target="_blank">mushroom coffee featuring chaga</a>. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.</p> <p>People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement right now -- this is the answer.

He is arguably best known for his 1971 <a href= "http://www.prisonexp.org/" target="_blank">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>, in which students were turned into mock prisoners and guards for a continuous 24-hour-a-day study. The experiment was planned for two weeks but terminated after just six days.</p> <p>In this podcast, we explore how we -- as humans -- can do less evil, how you can be a "deviant for day," mindful disobedience, and much more. It was a blast.</p> <p>Apart from the above, Dr. Zimbardo has served as President of the <a href="http://www.apa.org/" target="_blank">American Psychological Association</a> and designed and narrated the award-winning 26-part PBS series, <a href= "http://www.learner.org/series/discoveringpsychology/" target= "_blank">Discovering Psychology</a>.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-38"><p>Coming to you from a late night in rural Japan, this is a special edition of The Random Show.</p> <p>Per usual for The Random Show, I am joined by Kevin Rose (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/kevinrose" target= "_blank">@KevinRose</a>), serial entrepreneur, world-class investor, and all around wild and crazy guy. We discuss Japan and how to do it cheaply, building apps, urine drinking, love and marriage, beauty and absurdity in 2017, why Kevin doesn't have New Year's resolutions, favorite books, and much more.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://tim.blog/scale/" target="_blank">iD Commerce + Logistics</a>. I'm asked all the time about how to scale businesses quickly. Rule number one: remove unnecessary bottlenecks. Many businesses can do so by outsourcing inventory management and fulfillment to a company that makes this its primary focus.</p> <p><a href="http://tim.blog/scale/" target="_blank">iD Commerce + Logistics</a> is just such a company. It helps online retailers and entrepreneurs outgrow their competition by handling all types of details -- from inventory to packing and shipping. I depended on iD to handle these types of details when I launched <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em> so I could focus on promoting the book. As a listener of this podcast, you can get up to $10,000 off your start-up fees and costs waived by visiting <a href= "http://tim.blog/scale/" target= "_blank">tim.blog/scale</a> or <a href= "http://idcomlog.com/tim/" target= "_blank">idcomlog.com/tim</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "https://wealthfront.com/tim" target= "_blank">Wealthfront</a>. Wealthfront is the future of financial advice. It's become especially popular among my friends in Silicon Valley and across the country because it provides the same high-end financial advice that the best private wealth managers deliver to the ultra wealthy -- but for any account size, at a fraction of the cost.</p> <p><a href="https://wealthfront.com/tim" target= "_blank">Wealthfront</a> monitors your portfolio every day across more than a dozen asset classes to find opportunities for rebalancing and harvesting tax losses, and now manages more than $5 billion in assets. Unlike old-fashioned private wealth managers, Wealthfront is powered by innovative technology, making it the most tax-efficient, low-cost, hassle-free way to invest. Go to <a href="http://wealthfront.com/tim" target= "_blank">wealthfront.com/tim</a> to take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and it'll show you -- for free -- exactly the portfolio it would recommend. If you want to just take the advice and do it yourself, you can. Or, as I would, you can set it and forget it. Well worth a few minutes: <a href="http://wealthfront.com/tim" target= "_blank">wealthfront.com/tim</a>. As a Tim Ferriss Show listener, you'll get your first $15,000 managed for free if you decide to go with its services.</p></div>

It left me in hysterics on a transatlantic flight and terrified everyone. I couldn't stop laughing out loud.

He worked in various tech companies before retiring at age 30. Pete, his wife, and their now eleven-year-old son live near Boulder, Colorado, and have not had real jobs since 2005.</p> <p>This begs the question of "How?" In essence, they accomplished this early retirement by optimizing all aspects of their lifestyle for maximal fun at minimal expense, and by using basic index-fund investing. Their average annual expenses total a mere $25-27,000, and they do not feel in want of anything.</p> <p>Since 2005, all three of them have explored a free-form life of interesting projects, side-businesses, and adventures.</p> <p>In 2011, Pete started writing <a href= "http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/" target="_blank">the Mr. Money Mustache blog</a> about his philosophy, which has grown to reach about 23 million different people (and 300 million page views) since its founding. It has become a worldwide cult phenomenon, with a self-organizing community and incredible news coverage. This episode explores his story, philosophies, and routines.</p> <p>Without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with the one and only Mr. Money Mustache, Pete Adeney.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://www.varidesk.com/" target="_blank">Varidesk</a>.

He is a rated chess master who was awarded a Life Title by the United States Chess Federation. As a teenager, he was personally mentored by Bobby Fischer in the 18 months leading up to his winning the world championship.</p> <p>Then, in his first career, he developed a revolutionary approach to taking standardized tests as one of the two original co-founders of The Princeton Review. His paradigm-breaking -- or "category killing," as they say in publishing -- test-prep book, <em>The SAT: Cracking the System</em>, is the only test-prep book ever to have become a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. After selling his interest in The Princeton Review, Adam turned his attention in the early '90s to the then-emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing a program that could analyze text and provide human-like commentary. He was later invited to join a well-known quant fund to develop statistical trading models, and since, he has established himself as an independent global macro advisor to the chief investment officers of a select group of the world's most successful hedge funds and family offices.</p> <p>In his spare time, he's also become pen pals with Warren Buffett.</p> <p>This is a wide-ranging conversation (aka <em>conversational parkour</em>) with lots of takeaways.

Here's just one example: you can graph the impact on Yahoo's stock price by various posts by Kara. That's just the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>She attended Georgetown's School of Foreign Service prior to changing course to journalism. It turns out many of the skills that would make a good spy are those that make a good journalist: developing sources, asking good questions, scenario planning, and much more. She forged her reputation at the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, and now she spends the majority of her time as Executive Editor of <a href="http://www.recode.net/" target= "_blank">Recode</a> and the host of the <a href= "http://www.recode.net/recode-decode-podcast-kara-swisher" target= "_blank">Recode Decode podcast.</a></p> <p>Over the last 11 years and alongside <a href= "https://twitter.com/waltmossberg" target="_blank">Walt Mossberg</a>, she has also co-produced <a href= "http://allthingsd.com/20131231/you-say-goodbye-and-we-say-hello/" target="_blank">D: All Things Digital</a>, a major high-tech conference with interviewees such as <a href= "https://www.gatesnotes.com/" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target= "_blank">Steve Jobs</a>, and many other leading players in the tech and media industries.</p> <p>In this podcast episode, she and I cover a lot of subjects, enjoy quite a few laughs, and dig into details you can readily apply and test yourself. Topics include:</p> <ul> <li>The art and craft of good questions</li> <li>Lessons learned and favorite moments from interviewing Steve Jobs</li> <li>What separates good from great journalists</li> <li>War stories, missed opportunities, and "optimistic pessimism"</li> </ul> <p>I hope that you enjoy this episode with Kara Swisher!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.athleticgreens.com/tim" target="_blank">Athletic Greens</a>.

And if there were an answer to share with one of you, I'd share it with my whole audience -- which diminishes its usefulness as a competitive edge considerably.</p> <p>Without further ado, here <em>are</em> the questions I'm answering this time around.

Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfbB53gEAHA" target= "_blank">YouTube videos</a>?" They're a very specific set of shirts from <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">Rhone</a>. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me.</p> <p><a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone</a> has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts</a>, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout and a special holiday bonus.

Think of him as a philosopher-king programmer, master teacher, and merry prankster. Originally a professional musician and circus clown (he did the latter to counterbalance being introverted), Derek created <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Baby" target="_blank">CD Baby</a> in 1998. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100 million in sales for 150,000 musicians.</p> <p>In 2008, Derek sold CD Baby for $22 million, giving the proceeds to a charitable trust for music education. He is a frequent speaker at the TED Conference, with more than five million views of his talks. In addition to publishing 33 books via his company Wood Egg, he is the author of <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591848261/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur</a>, a collection of short life lessons that I've read at least a dozen times. I still have an early draft with highlights and notes.</p> <p>I posted the following on Facebook while writing this chapter: "I might need to do a second volume of [<a href= "http://toolsoftitans.com" target="_blank">Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers</a>], 100% dedicated to the knowledge bombs of Derek Sivers. So much good stuff. Hard to cut."</p> <p>Here's a bit of what made it into the first edition -- cherry-picked from the nuggets I've applied to my own life.

Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfbB53gEAHA" target= "_blank">YouTube videos</a>?" They're a very specific set of shirts from <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">Rhone</a>. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me.</p> <p><a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone</a> has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts</a>, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout. Find 'em at <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">rhone.com/tim</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "http://trunkclub.com/tim" target="_blank">TrunkClub</a>.

The last time, three out of the 20, which is exactly 15%, were female. Unfortunately, those women (and several guys) did not pick up.</p> <p>This time around, I decided to try the "ladies night" format. In this episode, we discuss:</p> <ul> <li>Language learning</li> <li>Exercising with (or around) injuries</li> <li>Viral marketing</li> <li>Handstands and handstand training</li> <li>How I decide my experiments (and what gets shared afterward)</li> <li>Teaching disabilities vs. learning disabilities</li> <li>The craft of writing: common mistakes, goals, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Please enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://vimeo.com/tim10" target="_blank">Vimeo Business</a>.

Nav established his lab there to further the understanding of how mitochondria work as signaling organelles to regulate physiology and pathology. He is also the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1621821293/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Navigating Metabolism</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps you've heard of people in Silicon Valley taking metformin, rapamycin, and supplements for longevity. In this conversation, we dig into the real science, what current evidence supports (or doesn't), and other important matters like how to staple properly, which fonts reasonable people use, and why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009EE87NK/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Borat</a> is a genius. Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target= "_blank">99Designs</a>, the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers. I have used them for years to create some amazing designs. When your business needs a logo, website design, business card, or anything you can imagine, check out 99Designs.</p> <p>I used them to <a href="http://99designs.com/tim" target= "_blank">rapid prototype the cover</a> for <em>The 4-Hour Body</em>, and I've also had them help with display advertising and illustrations. If you want a more personalized approach, I recommend their <a href="http://99designs.com/tim" target= "_blank">1-on-1 service</a>. You get original designs from designers around the world. The best part? You provide your feedback, and then you end up with a product that you're happy with or your money back. <a href="http://www.99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">Click this link</a> and get a free $99 upgrade. Give it a test run.</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target="_blank">Four Sigmatic</a>. I reached out to these Finnish entrepreneurs after a very talented acrobat introduced me to one of their products, which blew my mind (in the best way possible). It is <a href="http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target="_blank">mushroom coffee featuring chaga</a>. It tastes like coffee, but there are only 40 milligrams of caffeine, so it has less than half of what you would find in a regular cup of coffee. I do not get any jitters, acid reflux, or any type of stomach burn. It put me on fire for an entire day, and I only had half of the packet.</p> <p>People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement -- right now, this is the answer. You can try it right now by going to <a href="http://foursigmatic.com/tim" target= "_blank">foursigmatic.com/tim</a> and using the code Tim to get 20 percent off your first order. If you are in the experimental mindset, I do not think you'll be disappointed.</p></div>

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-70"><p>Thanks to the gin I had tonight, this is a special episode. It is a drunk-dialing Q&A with you guys -- like we did around this time last year <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/11/drunk-dialing/" target= "_blank">to celebrate the 100th episode</a>. In preparation, I solicited phone numbers from listeners who wanted to receive a call from me.</p> <p>In this episode, I cover topics such as:</p> <ul> <li>parenting advice from friends and guests</li> <li>how to get started in podcasting</li> <li>how to make a good sales pitch</li> <li>long-distance moves</li> <li>what I consider good advice</li> <li>and much, much more!</li> </ul> <p>Without further ado, please enjoy this alcohol-fueled Q&A!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">Rhone Apparel</a>. Dozens -- maybe even hundreds of you -- have asked me: "What shirts are you wearing in your recent <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfbB53gEAHA" target= "_blank">YouTube videos</a>?" They're a very specific set of shirts from <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">Rhone</a>. I'm packing for a trip for seven to ten days, and I would say half of what I'm going to pack is from Rhone. These are the most comfortable shirts (and Rhone stocks way more than shirts) that I have ever worn -- at least for active wear. But you can even sneak them into a business casual event or dinner if you're a Long Island kid like me.</p> <p><a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone</a> has minimal branding, so you don't feel like you're walking around with some sort of billboard on your chest. They come with pure, melted-down silver in the fabric -- anti-odor technology so you don't smell like a musk ox halfway through the day. I love <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target= "_blank">Rhone's shirts, pants, and shorts</a>, and I've been wearing them pretty much every day for the past few weeks. Luckily, there's no risk in trying them out: free shipping and a 100-day return policy should help you decide if they're worth it. Plus, listeners get an exclusive 15% off for using the code TIM at checkout. Find 'em at <a href="https://rhone.com/tim" target="_blank">rhone.com/tim</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is also brought to you by <a href= "http://audible.com/tim" target="_blank">Audible</a>. I have used <a href="http://audible.com/tim" target= "_blank">Audible</a> for years, and I love audiobooks.

He is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is a legend in the Special Operations world. His eyes look <em>through</em> you more than <em>at</em> you.</p> <p>Jocko spent 20 years in the US Navy and commanded SEAL Team 3's task unit Bruiser, the most highly decorated special operations unit in the Iraq War. Upon returning to the US, Jocko served as the officer in charge of training for all West Coast SEAL teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic -- and perhaps psychotic -- combat training in the world (his words, not mine).</p> <p>After retiring from the Navy, he co-founded <a href= "http://www.echelonfront.com/" target="_blank">Echelon Front</a>, a leadership and management consulting company and authored the number one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00VE4Y0Z2/theartofchapo-20" target="_blank">Extreme Ownership: How US Navy SEALs Lead and Win</a>.</p> <p>Jocko did his first interview ever with me (<a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/09/25/jocko-willink/" target= "_blank">find it here</a>), and it took the Internet by storm.

He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing, strategic quitting, leadership, and -- most of all -- challenging the status quo in all areas. His books include <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591844096/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Linchpin</a>, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591842336/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Tribes</a>, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591841666/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Dip</a>, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591843170/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Purple Cow</a>, and <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1936719320/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">What to Do When it's Your Turn (and it's Always Your Turn)</a>.</p> <p>Seth has founded several companies, including <a href= "http://www.wired.com/1998/10/yahoo-acquiring-yoyodyne/" target= "_blank">Yoyodyne</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidoo" target= "_blank">Squidoo</a>. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/" target="_blank">His blog</a> (which you can find by typing "Seth" into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. In 2013, Godin was inducted into <a href= "https://thedma.org/news/seth-godin-don-peppers-and-martha-rogers-2013-dma-hall-of-fame-inductees/" target="_blank">the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame</a>. Recently, Godin turned the book publishing world on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal in just three hours and became the most successful book project in Kickstarter history.</p> <p><a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/" target="_blank">His last episode</a> was quite a bit longer and dug deep into his bio, routines, philosophies, and suggestions.</p> <p>This one is much shorter -- think of it as philosophical steroids. It may take a few minutes to get into, so be patient. Here, you'll find pithy, actionable things that you can implement, such has how to keep track of the right things and how to create a narrative that serves you best. It's very simple, but it's a foundational skill and mindset that I try to practice myself.

That includes Ben Franklin, legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick, and many, many more. It is also how I built my network, how <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307465357/offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">my first book</a> hit the tipping point, how I became successful at angel investing, and the list goes on.</p> <p>Of course, if you're interested in the networking part of it, you can also read the blog post and listen to the episode, <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/08/26/how-to-build-a-world-class-network-in-record-time/" target="_blank">How to Build a World-Class Network in Record Time</a>.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-99"><p>Marc Andreessen (<a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca" target= "_blank">@pmarca</a>) is a legendary figure in Silicon Valley -- and worldwide. Even in the epicenter of tech, it's hard to find a more fascinating icon.</p> <p>Marc co-created the highly influential <a href= "http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic" target= "_blank">Mosaic</a> Internet browser, the first widely used graphical web browser. He also co-founded <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)" target= "_blank">Netscape</a>, which later sold to AOL for $4.2 billion. Then he co-founded Loudcloud, which sold as <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsware" target="_blank">Opsware</a> to Hewlett Packard for $1.6 billion.</p> <p>He's considered one of the founding fathers of the modern Internet, right alongside pioneers like <a href= "https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, who launched the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and early HTML standards.</p> <p>This all makes him one of the few humans ever to create software categories used by more than a billion people. He's also one of the few who's established multiple billion-dollar companies.</p> <p>Marc is now co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm <a href="http://a16z.com/" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, where he's quickly become one of the most influential and dominant tech investors in the world.</p> <p>In this interview, we dig into some fun things Marc has not discussed in many places, including:</p> <ul> <li>His epic debate vs. Peter Thiel</li> <li>Rules for investing</li> <li>The future of bitcoin</li> <li>Artificial intelligence</li> <li>Favorite books, documentaries, and movies</li> <li>And much, much more</li> </ul> <p>We had an extremely detailed and rich conversation, and I hope you enjoy it.

Honnold is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control his fear while scaling cliffs of dizzying heights without a rope to protect him if he falls.</p> <p>His most celebrated achievements include the first and only free-solos of the Moonlight Buttress (5.12d, 1,200 feet) in Zion National Park, Utah, and the Northwest Face (5.12a) of Half Dome (2,200 feet), Yosemite, California.</p> <p>In 2012, he achieved Yosemite’s first “Triple Solo”: climbing, in succession, the National Park’s three largest faces—Mt. Watkins, Half Dome and El Capitan—alone, and in under 24 hours.</p> <p>He is also the founder of the <a href= "http://www.honnoldfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Honnold Foundation</a>, an environmental non-profit, and to this day, he maintains his simple “dirtbag-climber” existence, living out of his van and traveling the world in search of the next great vertical adventure.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target= "_blank">99Designs</a>, the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers.

As a world-renowned Olympic coach, Sommer is known for building his students into some of the strongest, most powerful athletes in the world.</p> <p>During his extensive 40-year coaching career, Coach Sommer took meticulous notes on his training techniques—his wins and failures—so that he could translate the best elements into a superior exercise system for both high-level and beginner athletes. His four decades of careful observation led to the birth of Gymnastics Strength Training™ (or GST).</p> <p>In this episode, we cover A TON, including:</p> <ul> <li>The 3-5 exercises everyone should be doing (you’ve never heard of some of them)</li> <li>His opinions of kipping exercises, such as the kipping pull-ups common in CrossFit</li> <li>What bodyweight goals non-gymnasts should target</li> <li>Which exercises to remove from the gym entirely, at least in the first 6-12 months of training</li> <li>How to optimize biceps strength and mass with straight-arm work</li> <li>And much, much more...</li> </ul> <p>I also asked Coach Sommer to gather some interesting stuff (samples, videos, etc.) at <a href= "http://www.gymnasticbodies.com/tim" target= "_blank">gymnasticbodies.com/tim</a>, so take a gander. I don’t get any compensation for any of it; I just want people to consider more bodyweight training. I’ve found it revelatory and mind-expanding.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This episode is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.headspace.com/tim">Headspace</a>, the world’s most popular meditation app (more than 4,000,000 users).  It’s used in more than 150 countries, and many of my closest friends swear by it.  Try Headspace’s <a href= "https://www.headspace.com/tim" target="_blank">free Take10 program</a> —  10 minutes of guided meditation a day for 10 days.

His performing career began in 1984 when he faked his way into the Baltimore Opera to get his union card and meet girls, both of which he accomplished during a performance of Rigoletto. His transition to television occurred in 1990 when — to settle a bet — he auditioned for the QVC Shopping Channel and was promptly hired after talking about a pencil for nearly eight minutes. There, he worked the graveyard shift for three years, until he was ultimately fired for making fun of products and belittling viewers.</p> <p>Why listen to this episode?

They declined to reprint it. It wasn't until after his subsequent novel (<em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061578959/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061578959" target="_blank">Brida</a></em>) that <em>The Alchemist</em> was revived and took off.</p> <p>I, for one, have always been impressed with consistent writers. Paulo, who averages one book every two years, is staggeringly consistent. As I type this, I am under the pressure of deadlines and often feel as Kurt Vonnegut did: "When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth."</p> <p>My output is erratic at best, and I wondered: how does Paulo write? What is his process? How does he think about it?</p> <p>I reached out to him, and he was kind enough to reply with the audio I've included in the podcast.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-113"><p>I once wrote, "We all like to appear 'successful' (a nebulous term at best) and the media likes to portray standouts as superheroes...Most 'superheroes' are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk."</p> <p>Focusing on what people accomplish without understanding the mindset that allows them to experience that success leads to limited results. To help close the gap, I wanted to share <a href="http://audible.com/TimsBooks" target= "_blank">On The Shortness of Life</a> by Seneca the Younger. It's a short letter written roughly two thousand years ago, yet it's timeliness.</p> <p>This is an essay that I revisit at least once a quarter because it focuses on how much time we're given in life, and how it's oftentimes misused or wasted.</p> <p>You can listen to my favorite portion here, which begins with:</p>  <p><em>"Why do you torment yourself and lose weight over some problem..."</em></p>  <p>This is a fantastic reminder to mind the critical few and to ignore the trivial many.</p> <p>You can listen to this one and the rest of the collection via the <a href="http://audible.com/TimsBooks" target="_blank">Tao of Seneca</a> at <a href="http://audible.com/TimsBooks" target= "_blank">Audible.com/TimsBooks</a>.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.bollandbranch.com/" target="_blank">Boll & Branch.</a> There is a lot of nonsense in the bedding business. For instance, did you know thread-count is not a good measurement of quality? It’s a total myth. The “Made in Italy” label? It isn’t something you should necessarily pay extra for because it generally means it’s just finished in Italy and woven in places like China.</p> <p>The general industry mark-up for bedding is 700 to 800 percent at most retailers. <a href="https://www.bollandbranch.com/" target="_blank">Boll & Branch</a> creates incredibly high-quality bedding. They are the same sheets you’ll find at my home in San Francisco.</p> <p>The best part? You can try anything you order at home for 30 days. If you don’t love it, send it back and get a full refund. Go to <a href="https://www.bollandbranch.com/" target="_blank">Boll & Branch</a> and use promo code “TIM” for 20% off your entire order.

This is an in-depth jam session, and you can definitely listen to this one independently.</p> <p>Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie <em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Searching-Bobby-Fischer-Joe-Mantegna/dp/6305910340/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Searching for Bobby Fischer</a></em>.</p> <p>Considered a chess prodigy, he has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian jiu-jitsu (he’s a black belt under phenom Marcelo Garcia) and Tai Chi push hands (he’s a world champion). These days, he spends his time coaching the world’s top performers, whether Mark Messier, Cal Ripken Jr., or high-profile investors. I initially met Josh through his incredible book, <em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Learning-Journey-Performance/dp/0743277465/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Art of Learning</a></em>, which I loved so much that I helped produce the audiobook (<a href= "http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Art-of-Learning-Audiobook/B00JAOOBHU/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">download here</a> at Audible).</p> <p>If you're interested in implementing programs designed by Josh in your classroom, go to <a href= "http://theartoflearningproject.org" target= "_blank">theartoflearningproject.org</a> and find out if the program is a good fit for you.</p> <p>This episode is DEEP, in the best way possible.

This is an excerpt from my favorite writing of all time. This letter is #22, "On the Futility of Halfway Measures." As usual, Seneca takes a little time in his preamble to get warmed up. That is his style. He seems to enjoy feeling out the recipient of his letter before jumping into the details.</p> <p>I love this letter because it addresses how we spend our time, which is one of the biggest stresses for all people, and especially entrepreneurs.</p> <p>My favorite portion is:</p>  <p><em>"Hence men leave such advantages as these with reluctance."</em></p>  <p>I encourage you to listen to this and think of ways that you can adapt Seneca's wisdom to your own life.

He has also made himself a guinea pig — Cal has boxed against world champion Julio Cesar Chavez and served as a sommelier atop of the World Trade Center. He now lives with his wife—whom he met while on a quest to discover the world’s most beautiful beach—and his three children in Los Angeles, where he spends every morning eating breakfast with Larry King.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://audible.com/tim" target="_blank">Audible</a>.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-118"><p>If you've enjoyed my previous <em>in-between episodes</em> , then this might be your favorite episode ever. It's one of the most actionable, information-packed interviews I've ever done.</p> <p>This time, it's Joel Stein (<a href= "https://twitter.com/thejoelstein" target= "_blank">@TheJoelStein</a>) asking the questions. Joel is one of the funniest writers I have ever read, and he's great at leading an interview.</p> <p>Here's how it all happened: Joel wanted me to help him figure out 5 areas he could improve for an upcoming series he was going to create. I have many different conversations with journalists. It can be painful when I have a 1-2 hour conversation, and then it's cut to a single sentence as a quote in a piece. And it's often a misquote. So how do you fix that?</p> <p>Well, you record it yourself, which is what we did. (With Joel's approval, of course.) This way, you don't "lose" the content, and you cover your ass with media and journalists.</p> <p>In this episode, we discuss a wide variety of topics, including:</p> <ul> <li>How I choose what to improve from infinite options</li> <li>How you can subtract your way to success</li> <li>The genius of Ben Franklin</li> <li>Why self-improvement doesn't mean self-centered</li> <li>How I say no to time-consuming lunches, coffees, and other meetings</li> <li>How I tackle <em>cold introductions</em></li> <li>How I surmounted Lyme Disease</li> <li>My 100% complete break from start-ups (<a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/10/29/startup-vacation-2/" target="_blank">read this for more</a>)</li> <li>My podcast process</li> <li>Tools and tactics for reversing email overwhelm</li> </ul> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">99Designs</a>, the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-119"><p style="text-align: left;">At the behest of my astute legal counsel, here is a legal disclaimer for this episode:</p> <p>First, I am not recommending, endorsing, or supporting any of the substances or compounds (especially illegal) discussed or described in the interview. I am interviewing Patrick Arnold as a journalist seeking additional information regarding matters of public interest and concern.</p> <p>Second, I have removed some of the names of athletes who are alleged to have used performance enhancing drugs. I recognize that this seems excessive, but even if athletes have been publicly banned for drug usage, unless the ban relates to the specific substance and time period referenced in the podcast, I can be sued for defamation for repeating or publicizing these stories.</p> <p>With all that said, here we go...</p>  <p>If you liked <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/03/dominic-dagostino/">my episode with Dom D'Agostino</a>, you might love this one.</p> <p><a href="http://ketosports.com/" target="_blank">Patrick Arnold</a>, widely considered “the father of prohormones," is an organic chemist known for introducing androstenedione (remember Mark McGwire?), 1-Androstenediol (marketed as “1-AD”), and methylhexanamine into the dietary supplement market.</p> <p>He also created the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone, best known as THG and "the clear." THG, along with two other anabolic steroids that Patrick manufactured (best known: norbolethone), were not banned at the time of their creation. They were hard-to-detect drugs at the heart of the BALCO professional sports doping scandal, which thrust Barry Bonds and others into the spotlight. BALCO distributed these worldwide to world-class athletes in a wide variety of sports, ranging from track and field to professional baseball and football.</p> <p>Recently, Patrick has been innovating in the legal world of ketone supplementation, including breakthroughs in performance and taste with products like <a href= "http://ketosports.com/project/ketoforce/" target= "_blank">KetoForce</a> and <a href="http://ketosports.com/" target="_blank">KetoCaNa</a>, which were highlighted during <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/03/dominic-dagostino/" target="_blank">my podcast with Dominic D'Agostino, PhD</a>.</p> <p>If you'd like to meet the (in)famous Patrick Arnold in person, you can find him at <a href= "http://arnoldsportsfestival.com/?full_website" target="_blank">The Arnold Classic</a> in Colombus, Ohio from March 3-6, 2016 at Booth 328.</p> <p>Otherwise, you can check out his current concoctions for athletes <a href="http://ketosports.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://prototypenutrition.com/" target= "_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>In this science-dense conversation, we cover a ton, mostly related to better performance through chemistry. We also discuss Patrick's biggest successes and mistakes, his path to science, ursolic acid and other clever creations, exogenous ketone supplementation for sports, as well as nonsense in the media about anabolics (e.g. current Delta-2 scandal).</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p></div>

He has presented privately for Barack Obama, Bono, Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou, as well as for many Fortune 500 companies.</p> <p>Each one of these takes a few minutes to get warmed up, so be patient. There are gems in both. Among other things...</p> <ul> <li>Kaskade covers his first breaks, making his own luck, formative musical influences, and we dig into his notetaking process, and the origins of one of his biggest hits.</li> <li>Sekou will inspire you to be inspired by your story.

Do you need to get back on the horse, or have an effective pep talk in your back pocket?</li> </ul> <p>This might be the recording you listen to over and over again.

Among his formidable feats of strength:</p> <ul> <li>He's a 2x Olympic Gold medalist.</li> <li>He holds the X Games record for gold medals at 15, as well as the highest overall medal count at 24.</li> <li>Shaun has earned the number two spot on BusinessWeek's list of the 100 most powerful and marketable athletes.</li> <li>And -- ACH-TUNG! -- for those near L.A. or willing to travel, Shaun is hosting an incredible event called <a href= "http://airandstyle.com" target="_blank">Air + Style</a>. Think of it as X Games meets Coachella, where you can listen to world-famous bands and then see jumps off of a 16-story ramp (no joke), among other excitement.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-128"><p>This is a special episode that is the result of more than 10 years of dreaming. For years, I've been studying Stoicism, but I've always had a particular interest in The Tao of Seneca. What is the Tao of Seneca? There's a collection of letters called, "The Moral Letters to Lucilius." And I have read this entire collection of letters and other letters of Seneca, the author, probably more than 100 times. It has been my constant companion for at least the last 10 years. And I have given various forms of these letters to more friends than I can even count and several hundred acquaintances -- I feel that strongly about it. So when people ask me about my favorite book, I say this collection of letters.</p> <p>The problem has been there is no good audio edition. So I, for many months now, have made this my passion project to create <a href="http://www.audible.com/timsbooks" target= "_blank">The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master</a>. Three volumes, and it covers them all. Here's the description:</p> <p><em>The Tao of Seneca is an introduction to the stoic philosophy through the words of Seneca. Thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of stoicism, and NFL management (coaches and players, alike) have embraced it because the principles make them better competitors.</em></p> <p>This episode features letter #13, "On Groundless Fears." Stoicism is a no-nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real-world effects. Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments. This is your guide.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p>  <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.athleticgreens.com/tim" target="_blank">Athletic Greens</a>.

Sometimes the most life-changing habits are the ones we put off, and learning to cook is at the top of that list. I only finally took the plunge when writing <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>, and it turned my eating and my life into high definition. <a href="http://foodistkitchen.com/tim" target= "_blank">Foodist Kitchen</a> is a 30-day program that teaches you how to cook without recipes, and I highly recommend it. Chopping and sautéing are just a small part of the whole deal -- you also need to know what flavors taste good together and what it means to cook until done.</p> <p><a href="http://foodistkitchen.com/tim" target="_blank">Foodist Kitchen</a> brings all these skills together so you can walk into the kitchen, open the fridge, and have an intuitive sense of what to cook and how to do it. It was created by Darya Rose, who's a friend of mine and one of my cooking mentors for <em>The 4-Hour Chef</em>. She has offered a $15 discount off your membership, so check out <a href="http://foodistkitchen.com/tim" target= "_blank">FoodistKitchen.com/Tim</a> to learn more about the program.</p> <p>This episode is also brought to you by <a href= "https://www.exoprotein.com/tim" target="_blank">Exo Protein</a>. These guys are making protein bars using cricket protein powder. Before you screw your face up and look disgusted, I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before! With recipes that were developed by a three-Michelin-starred chef, the bars are paleo-friendly, with no gluten, no grains, no soy, no dairy, etc., and they won't pop up your glycemic response. In fact, they're less processed than any other protein bars you'll be able to find.</p> <p><a href="https://www.exoprotein.com/tim" target="_blank">Exo Protein</a> is offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss Show listeners -- if you go to <a href="https://www.exoprotein.com/tim" target="_blank">ExoProtein.com/Tim today</a>, you can try a sampler pack with all of the most popular flavors for less than $10.

This episode explores her training, nutrition, rehab, "pre-hab", and more.</p> <p>In a sense, Amelia is more impressive than MJ, as she conquered OCR while building a stellar full-time career in law.</p> <p>Since the sport’s inception, she’s amassed more than 30 victories and 50 podiums. In the 2012 <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Mudder" target= "_blank">World's Toughest Mudder</a> competition, which lasted 24 hours, she finished 2nd OVERALL out of 1,000+ competitors. This was ahead of every male except the winner, who beat her by just 8 minutes.</p> <p>Her major victories include the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_race" target= "_blank">Spartan Race World Championship</a> (2013), Spartan Race Series Point Champion (2013 and 2015), and she is the only three-time winner of the World's Toughest Mudder (2012, 2014 and 2015). She won the 2014 WTM eight weeks after knee surgery. Amelia is also a three-time finisher of the Death Race, and dabbles in ultra-running in all of her spare time.</p> <p>Phew...

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-141"><p>This is another special episode of <em>The Tim Ferriss Show.</em> Usually, when I talk about strategies for living a better life, I focus on strategies for effectiveness and efficiency. That is, finding ways for you to be better without wasting time. Both of these are important, but fine-tuning those traits come naturally for me. Mindfulness is something that is difficult and usually overlooked by most people.</p> <p>So why is mindfulness essential? When it comes to achievement, most people just work harder. In reality, you want to first achieve more focus and clarity, which can help guide your effort. This is the real benefit of mindfulness. Once you incorporate it into your life, you complain less, appreciate more, react less, and fill your life with what's most important to you. More than anything, you'll learn how to be present and live in the moment.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">99Designs</a>, the world’s largest marketplace of graphic designers. I have used them for years to create some amazing designs.

His other bestsellers include <em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Essays-Love-Alain-Botton/dp/0330440780/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447167575&sr=1-1&keywords=essays+in+love/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Essays In Love</a></em>, <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Status-Anxiety-Alain-Botton/dp/0375725350/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447167650&sr=1-1&keywords=Status+Anxiety/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Status Anxiety</a>, and <em><a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Happiness-Alain-Botton/dp/0307277240/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447167688&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Architecture+Of+Happiness/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">The Architecture Of Happiness</a></em>.

If <a href= "http://www.chasejarvis.com/" target="_blank">Chase Jarvis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton" target= "_blank">Laird Hamilton</a> had a love child, it would be Jimmy.</p> <p> He has participated in and documented breakthrough expeditions around the planet, from climbing first ascents in the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakoram" target= "_blank">Karakoram</a> to skiing first descents in the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas" target= "_blank">Himalayas</a>. He is one of the few people to both climb Mount Everest and ski it from the summit.  Most recently, he filmed and directed the incredible feature documentary <a href="http://www.merufilm.com/" target="_blank">MERU</a>, which is in theaters now and won the 2015 Audience Award at Sundance.</p> <p>What is <a href="http://www.merufilm.com/" target= "_blank">MERU</a>? In the high-stakes game of big-wall climbing, the Shark’s Fin on Mount Meru is the ultimate prize. Everest is a cakewalk by comparison. Sitting at the headwaters of the sacred Ganges River in Northern India, the Shark’s Fin has seen more failed attempts by elite climbing teams over the past 30 years than any other ascent in the Himalayas. <a title="" href= "http://www.fourhournewsletter.com/click.html?x=a62e&lc=Wp&mc=e&s=dWIbA&u=w&y=P&" target="_blank">This movie</a> is the story of one group’s journey to conquer it—a white-knuckle quest of friendship, sacrifice, hope and obsession. How Jimmy captured it on film while risking his life is almost impossible to fathom.</p> <p>In this episode of the podcast, we talk about his origins, training, nutrition, gear, and MERU, of course.</p> <p>Suffice to say, if you want a benevolent kick in the ass, the film <a href="http://www.merufilm.com/">MERU</a> is your assignment. I saw it a few weeks ago, and all my family could say for minutes afterward was, “Whoa….” My refrain was, “Holy shit…,” which I muttered to myself at least 20 times in 90 minutes.  It’s an amazing, terrifying, and inspiring edge-of-your-seat experience.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://trunkclub.com/tim" target="_blank">TrunkClub</a>.

It has exploded in popularity in the last 2 years, and now has more than $2.5B under management. In fact, some of my good investor friends in Silicon Valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams.

It was founded by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Camp" target= "_blank">Garrett Camp</a>, who co-founded <a href= "https://get.uber.com/cl/?city_name=denver&utm_source=AdWords_Brand&utm_campaign=search|c|drivers|denver|country-1|city-24|keyword_Uber|matchtype_e|ad_87468345520|campaign_brand|group_uber%3Eexact|network_g|apr30newexactKWrestructure|restructure&utm_medium=kenid_e4d8fca4-05cb-4dc6-a476-93e2e4295523&gclid=CK22zKaXuMgCFQiPaQodikIMiQ" target="_blank">Uber</a>. Every once in a blue moon, they put together a night of education. I was invited to participate.</p> <p>In this episode, I discuss the topic of <em>startup design vs. lifestyle design</em>. Some of you may be aware that I've been involved with various startups ranging from Uber to Facebook, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tferriss" target= "_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://en.duolingo.com/" target= "_blank">DuoLingo</a>, and other businesses that have grown to more than 100 million users and customers.</p> <p>Simultaneously, I have written many times about lifestyle design<em>,</em> and I've suggested that it should come before career planning. The question is, how do we reconcile these two different approaches to business?</p> <p>Should you focus on building your muse and creating cash-flow focused business to fuel your ideal lifestyle...or should you swing for the fences and bet it all on a startup that is equity driven? This podcast explores these topics -- and many more -- and aims to answer the questions that I think are under-examined.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "http://99designs.com/tim" target="_blank">99Designs</a>, the world’s largest marketplace of graphic designers.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-153"><p>Richard Betts (<a href= "https://twitter.com/yobetts" target="_blank">@yobetts</a>) served as the wine director at <a href="https://www.thelittlenell.com/" target="_blank">The Little Nell</a> in Aspen from 2000 to 2008. Much more interesting to me, Richard passed the Court of Master Sommeliers' Masters Exam on his first attempt, becoming the ninth person in history ever to do so.</p> <p>I first met Richard through <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/05/30/chris-sacca/" target= "_blank">investing wunderkind Chris Sacca</a>, and we immediately hit it off. Richard can help you train your senses for anything, including wine, whiskey, his current love of mezcal, and far beyond.</p> <p>He's also done a lot of wild experiments, got a lot of tattoos, almost been shot in Mexico, and developed an incredible ability to simplify the complex. We get along.</p> <p>In this conversation, we talk about nearly everything, ranging from the value of quitting to tricks of the trade, travel tips (he's traveling 300+ days per year), and "starter" wines.</p> <p>We also drink a boat-load of whiskey, me tasting and Richard teaching. The pictures below show a sample. Side note and cool rule of thumb: did you know it's spelled "whiskey" when from countries that have "e" in their names (e.g. America) but "whisky" when from countries that don't have an "e" in their names (e.g. Scotland, Japan)? Richard taught me that.</p> <p>Last but not least, Richard is the author of a brand-new book, “<a href="http://amzn.to/1LQjznx" target="_blank">The Essential Scratch & Sniff Guide to Becoming a Whiskey Know-It-All</a>,” which is sitting on my kitchen table with whiskey stains all over it. It distils (see what I did there?) a couple of lifetimes worth of study down to 24 pages...then makes them smell good. <a href= "http://amzn.to/1LQjznx" target="_blank">Definitely check it out</a>. At the very least, it gives you a bunch of rules of thumb (like the <em>whiskey</em> vs. <em>whisky</em> trick), so you can impress your friends and not look like a dumb-ass at the bar. Sweet! Less dumb-ass and more smart-ass is always good.

So far, <a href="https://angel.co/tim" target= "_blank">my startup bets</a> are 10x+ more successful (on paper) than my publishing career. Based on cashed-out positions, they're still several times more successful. I've had a lucky stretch.</p> <p>By no means am I an elite investor, but I've borrowed from elite investors since 2007.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-156"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jockowillink" target="_blank">Jocko Willink</a> (@jockowillink) is one of the scariest human beings imaginable.</p> <p>He is a lean 230 pounds. He is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert who used to tap out 20 Navy SEALs per workout. He is a legend in the Special Operations world. His eyes look <em>through</em> you more than <em>at</em> you.</p> <p>He rarely does interviews, if ever. But a few weeks ago, Jocko ended up staying at my house and we had a caffeinated mind meld. Here's some background...</p> <p>Jocko enlisted in the Navy after high school and spent 20 years in the SEAL Teams, first as an enlisted SEAL operator and then as a SEAL officer. During his second tour in Iraq, he led SEAL Task Unit Bruiser in the Battle of Ramadi--some of the toughest and sustained combat in the SEAL Teams since Vietnam.</p> <p>Under his leadership, Task Unit Bruiser became the most highly decorated Special Operations Unit of the entire war in Iraq and helped bring stability to Ramadi. Jocko was awarded the Bronze Star and a Silver Star.</p> <p>Upon returning to the United States, Jocko served as the Officer-in-Charge of training for all West Coast SEAL Teams, designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic combat training in the world.</p> <p>So why is Jocko opening up? Well, in part, we have mutual friends. Second, he is the co-author of an incredible new book — <a href="http://amzn.to/1MHS9l3" target="_blank">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</a> -- which I've been loving. Trust me. <a href="http://amzn.to/1MHS9l3" target="_blank">Buy it</a>.</p> <p>This is his first mainstream interview and one you won't want to miss.</p> <p>Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a>.</p> <p>This podcast is brought to you by <a class="gr-progress" href="https://wealthfront.com/tim" target= "_blank">Wealthfront</a>.

Most the time, I interview many world-class people, and I ask them many, many questions to try and figure out what makes them good at what they do.</p> <p style= "line-height: 16.8pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0 0 12pt;"> Many of you have wondered what would happen if I flipped the script and had to answer my own questions.

These are the five things I’d like to accomplish on an “ideal day.” If I can hit at least three of these items, then I’ve won the morning. And, as the saying goes, “If you win the morning, you win the day.”</p> <p style= "line-height: 16.8pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0 0 12pt;"> Let me know if you like this type of episode by responding to me on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tferriss" target= "_blank">@tferriss</a>) or <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/TimFerriss" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

Crossroads specializes in helping patients conquer powerful addictions (heroin, cocaine, etc.) by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine" target="_blank">African hallucinogen ibogaine</a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT" target= "_blank">5-MeO-DMT</a>, also referred to as “the God molecule.” Martin's areas of expertise also include addiction medicine and therapeutic neurotechnologies.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Dan Engle (<a href= "http://twitter.com/drdanengle" target="_blank">@drdanengle</a>), M.D., is a psychiatrist and neurologist, who combines functional medicine with integrative psychiatry to enhance regenerative health and peak performance. His prior and relevant experience includes traumatic brain injury (TBI) and working in the Peruvian jungle with plant medicines such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca" target= "_blank">ayahuasca</a>.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> In this episode, we step outside the lines of traditional medicine to discuss impulse control, introspection, and self-awareness through the use of powerful psychedelic and hallucinogenic agents like iboga, ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> We also discuss flotation tanks, which can simulate or even replicate many of the benefits that can result from the use of psychedelic and psychotropic agents. So you don't have to be willing to experiment with these medicines to receive something valuable from this episode.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> If you are interested in optimizing your psychological performance, emotional control and exploring alternative medicine, then this episode is for you.

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-160"><p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> 100 episodes! Whaaat?!</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> This celebratory episode involves me drunk dialing a bunch of you on Skype. We'll get to that. But first, a little background and thank you...</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> My podcast--<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/" target="_blank">The Tim Ferriss Show</a>--was started on a whim. It was intended as a break between big book projects. "I'll do six episodes to get better at interviewing" was the grand goal.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/04/22/tim-ferriss-podcast/" target="_blank">In the first episode</a> (and after two bottles of wine), <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinrose" target="_blank">Kevin Rose</a> nicknamed the show TimTimTalkTalk (damn you, <a href= "http://twitter.com/kevinrose" target= "_blank">KevKev</a>). Later, after reviewing my ridiculously slurred and iffy questions ("If you were a breakfast cereal, which would you be?"), I let out a long sigh. I've always hated the sound of my own voice, but this was the worst. The Tim-as-host idea would not last.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Or so I thought.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Now, here we are, passing the 100-episode mark. It's crazy, and I can say one thing for certain -- I've only made it this far because of YOU.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Your amazing feedback, support, questions, and comments are what kept this podcast alive. Amidst self-doubt (similar to <a href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/" target="_blank">this</a>) and many mistakes, I've wanted to throw in the towel more than once. But, through thick and thin, you've been there, telling my monkey mind to chill the fuck out, to take a deep breath, to go to sleep, to fight another day.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Thank you.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> To celebrate, and as a throwback to episode #1, I posted a note on Twitter and Facebook asking fans to put their contact information in a short Google form (note: I've deactivated the link):</p>  <p dir="ltr" lang="en" xml:lang="en">I'm going to be drunk dialing fans within 30 min, answering your questions!

We cover a lot of subjects, including:</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> - Tantric sex - How I view and organize my various income streams - Marketing yourself in job interviews - My views (and challenges) with family and kids - How I dig out of negative downward spirals - And much more...</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> I also left semi-coherent voicemails for a number of you.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Once again, thank you so much for listening to this podcast.

SHALLOW-WATER BLACKOUTS CAN BE FATAL.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Wim Hof (<a href="https://twitter.com/Iceman_Hof" target= "_blank">@Iceman_hof</a>) is a Dutch world record holder, adventurer and daredevil, commonly nicknamed “The Iceman" for his ability to withstand extreme cold. He is the creator of the <a href="http://www.wimhofmethod.com/video-miniclass" target="_blank">Wim Hof Method</a> and holds more than 20 world records. Wim is an outlier of outliers, as he routinely asks scientists to scrutinize and validate his feats. Here are just a few examples:</p> <ul style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> <li>In 2007, he climbed past the “death zone" altitude on Mount Everest (~7,500 meters) wearing nothing but shorts.</li> <li>In 2009, Hof completed a full marathon above the polar circle in Finland, in temperatures close to −20 °C (−4 °F). Dressed in nothing but shorts, Hof finished in 5 hours and 25 minutes.</li> <li>Hof holds the current Guinness World Record for the longest ice bath, now set at 1 hour 53 minutes and 12 seconds.</li> </ul> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> But it’s not just cold.</p> <ul style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> <li>In 2011, he ran a full marathon in the Namib Desert without water. The run was performed under the supervision of Dr. Thijs Eijsvogels. He can also run at altitude without suffering from altitude sickness.</li> <li>In the same year, he was injected with toxins under doctor supervision and demonstrated that he could effectively control his autonomic immune response. Wim was able to raise his cortisol levels and lower his blood concentrations of cytokines (inflammatory mediators) using solely his meditation and prep techniques.</li> </ul> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Not only this, but he was able to train others to achieve the same effect… with only 4 days of training!</p> <p> </p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> We dig into all this and more.  I loved this conversation and hope you do, too...</p> <p>All show notes, links, and resources from this episode can be found at <a style="line-height: 21.8181819915772px;" href= "http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> This episode is brought to you by <a href= "http://www.audible.com/tim" target= "_blank">Audible</a>, which I have used for years.

He is also the founder and chairman of <a href="http://www.elreynetwork.com/" target="_blank">El Rey Network</a>, the new genre-busting English-language cable network.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> While a student at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, Robert Rodriguez wrote the script to his first feature film while he was a paid subject in a clinical experiment at a drug research facility. That paycheck covered the cost of shooting his film. He planned to make the money back by selling the film to the Mexican home video market.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> The film, “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104815/" target= "_blank">El Mariachi</a>,” went on to win the coveted Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and became the lowest budget movie ever released by a major studio. Rodriguez wrote about these experiences in <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Rebel-without-Crew-23-Year-Old-Filmmaker/dp/0452271878/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20" target="_blank">Rebel Without a Crew</a>, a perennial guide for the independent filmmaker.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Rodriguez went on to write, produce, direct and edit a series of successful films including Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, the Spy Kids franchise, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Frank Miller’s Sin City, and Machete.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> I hope you find listening to this episode as much fun as it was to record.</p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> For all links, show notes, resources from this episode, please visit <a style="line-height: 21.8181819915772px;" href= "fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></p> <p style= "color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> This podcast is brought to you by <a href= "https://www.athleticgreens.com/tim" target="_blank">Athletic Greens</a>. I get asked all the time, “If you could only use one supplement, what would it be?” My answer is, inevitably, <a href= "https://www.athleticgreens.com/tim" target="_blank">Athletic Greens</a>. It is my all-in-one nutritional insurance.

Other directing credits include Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Cowboys & Aliens, Elf, Zathura, and Chef, which he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in.    Lots of commas!  This man does everything.   Recent acting credits include The Wolf of Wall Street and Identity Thief.  Favreau is currently directing a live-action film with groundbreaking technology that blow your mind — an adaptation of Disney’s Jungle Book, set to be released on April 15, 2016.   In our conversation, we dig deep into his creative process, how he writes, the inflection points in his career, how he prepared for Chef, and much more. The impact of Dungeons and Dragons?

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-194">The goal of this blog and my podcast is to push you outside of your comfort zone and force you to question assumptions.  This why I invite divergent thinkers and world-class performers who often disagree.  I might interview Tony Robbins (<a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-37-tony-robbins-on-morning/id863897795?i=320102531&mt=2">Part 1</a>, <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-38-tony-robbins-part-2/id863897795?i=320102530&mt=2"> Part 2</a>) and then <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-61-benevolent-dictator/id863897795?i=335184703&mt=2"> Matt Mullenweg</a>, as I did. Or I might have <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ep.-14-sam-harris-phd-spirituality/id863897795?i=315012211&mt=2"> Sam Harris, PhD</a> on and later invite a seemingly opposite guest like...   <a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/">Glenn Beck</a>.   This interview is a wild ride, and it happened — oddly enough -- thanks to a late-night sauna session.  I was catching up with an old friend, who is mixed-race, a Brown University grad, and liberal in almost every sense of the word.  I casually asked him, “If you could pick one person to be on the podcast, who would it be?"   “Glenn Beck,” he answered without a moment’s hesitation. “His story is FASCINATING."   He went on to describe how Glenn hit rock bottom and restarted his life in his 30’s. Fast forward to 2014, Forbes named him to their annual Celebrity 100 Power List and pegged his earnings at $90 million for that year.  This placed him ahead of people like Mark Burnett, Jimmy Fallon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith. Glenn's site, <a href= "http://www.theblaze.com/">TheBlaze.com</a>, gets somewhere between 30 and 50 million unique visitors per month.   This interview is neither a “gotcha” interview nor a softball interview.  I ask some very tough questions (some from listeners), but my primary goal was to pull out routines, habits, books, etc. that you can use.  There is no political agenda whatsoever.   If anything, this is a story of entrepreneurship, and whether you love Glenn, hate Glenn, or have never heard his name, there is a lot to learn from him. <p> </p> Full show notes and links from this episode can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></div>

He can do in a few pages what I need several hours of screen time and tens of millions to accomplish. And he does it better. Come to think of it, I'd rather not do a blurb. I am beginning to feel bad about myself." - Judd Apatow</p> <p>And one more:</p> <p>"Tim Kreider may be the most subversive soul in America and his subversions—by turns public and intimate, political and cultural—are just what our weary, mixed-up nation needs. The essays in We Learn Nothing are for anybody who believes it's high time for some answers, damn it." - Richard Russo, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Empire Falls</p> <p>Enjoy! Don't miss this one.</p> <p>I will be putting up a collection of Tim's cartoons from the book at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></p> <p>All books in the Tim Ferriss Book Club can be found at <a href= "http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/books">fourhourworkweek.com/books</a></p></div>

He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594774021/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594774021&linkCode=as2&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkId=DWNDSZVYE5HZE7ZM">The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide</a>.Called “America’s wisest and most respected authority on psychedelics and their use,” Jim Fadiman has been involved with psychedelic research since the 1960s. In this episode, we discuss the immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics when used for spiritual purposes (high dose), therapeutic purposes (moderate dose), and problem-solving purposes (low dose). Fadiman outlines best practices for safe "entheogenic" voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.We also discuss new uses for LSD and other psychedelics, including extremely low doses for improved cognitive function. Cautioning that psychedelics are not for everyone, he dispels the myths and misperceptions about psychedelics, which are commonly circulated in textbooks. Fadiman explain how -- in his opinion -- psychedelics, used properly, can lead not only to healing but also to scientific breakthroughs and spiritual epiphanies.Show notes and links for this episode can be found at <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast">www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast</a></p></div>

You've probably seen his shows <em>Bizarre Foods</em> and <em>Dining with Death</em>. In 2010 <em>and</em> 2013 he was awarded the James Beard Foundation Award, which annually presents awards for excellence in cuisine, culinary writing, and culinary television.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.7272720336914px; line-height: 19px;">But many people don't know the earlier chapters in his life.  At one point, he was sleeping on the streets, stealing purses, and shooting heroin. In our interview, he shares all.  We delve into everything, including his culinary tricks, how he developed his hit TV show, his influences, key turning points in his life, beating addiction, and much more.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.7272720336914px; line-height: 19px;">This is a powerful interview.</p>

I read very few blogs regularly, but BrainPickings is one of the few.  It is a treasure trove.BrainPickings is Maria's one-woman labor of love — her subjective lens on what matters in the world and why. It's also an inquiry into how to live and what it means to lead a good life.  From Mark Twain to Oscar Wilde and everyone in between, Maria finds hidden gems to share.And that's what I hoped to do in this episode.  It takes me a few minutes to warm up in this interview, but as soon as we get going, we geek out like crazy, talking about almost every aspect of her life, her site, her business, and her writing.</p>
<p>I loved doing this interview, and I hope you love listening to it.  There are a lot of valuable nuggets.</p></div>

How could a history podcast have a cult following?And yet it did. During research for launching The Tim Ferriss Show, I asked many of the top dogs on the iTunes charts: what is your favorite podcast? Almost without exception, the answer came back: Hardcore History.Since then, I've become friends with Dan (and more obsessed with his show), and this episode explores all the questions I've been dying to ask him, whether related to his early experiments, his "radio" voice, creativity, building podcasts, and much more.</p>

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-260"><p>This episode features Ryan Holiday, who became Director of Marketing at American Apparel at age 21 (!).Since dropping out of college at 19 to apprentice under the strategist Robert Greene, Ryan has advised many bestselling authors (including yours truly) and multi-platinum musicians.  He is master of the media, and he knows how to both build massive buzz and respond to unexpected crises.</p>
<p>I hired him to help with the launches of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef, and his unorthodox approaches always impress.  He takes the paths less traveled.In this episode, we discuss dozens of topics, including the real-world strategies he uses to thrive (not just survive) when the world is exploding around him.Enjoy!</p>

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-261"><p>This episode features two incredible guests: Dr. Justin Mager and Kelly Starrett. We all drink wine and get crazy.  </p>
<p>Dr. Mager is my personal doctor and has helped me with dozens of my crazy experiments, complete with blood testing and next-gen tracking. Kelly Starrett is one of the top Crossfit coaches in the world, and one of my favorite PTs and performance trainers. His clients include Olympic gold medalists, Tour de France cyclists, world and national record holders in Olympic lifting and powerlifting, Crossfit Games medalists, ballet dancers, and elite military personnel. If you're interested in taking your body or mind to the next level, or attempting to become the guy from Limitless, this episode is for you.</p>

            <div style="display:none;" id="tfl-item-description-262"><p>Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie "Searching for Bobby Fischer." Considered a chess prodigy, he has learning strategies that can be applied to anything, including his other loves of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (he's a black belt under Marcelo Garcia) and Tai Chi Push Hands (he's a world champion).  Now, he spends his time coaching the world's top performers, whether Mark Messier, Cal Ripken Jr., or hedgefund managers. This episode is DEEP in the best way possible.  And for a change from Episode 1, I'm totally sober.</p></div>

Since 2012, he is a venture partner at Google Ventures.  He's also a hilarious dude, and this episode involves heavy drinking.</p></div>
