### Tim Ferriss Podcast List

Generate an HTML file from Tim Ferriss' RSS feed. The purpose of this generated HTML file is to make it easy to browse and download the podcasts. I love Tim's work, but the podcast section is a bit of a mess.

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in a web browser to see the list of podcasts.

### Tim's Blog and Podcast

Tim's [Blog](https://tim.blog/) and [Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/) are absolutely phenomenal resources.
